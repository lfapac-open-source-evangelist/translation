# The OSPO journey

The first step for many OSPOs, before they can begin to address more strategic concerns, is what many OSPO leaders described as cleaning up the mess of open source, recovering from years of ad hoc approaches to consuming and contributing to open source.

“We’ve had 10 years of publishing projects without a longer-term plan or formalized ownership,” said Ploug, of Spotify. The OSPO is currently going through all the projects that the company has created, figuring out who owns them—and making sure that ownership is assigned to a team, not an individual. There is also a process of determining which projects can be shut down, which requires confirming that there is no internal use.

Other work that OSPOs often tackle initially is finite and can, at some point, be finished, such as the initial question about which licenses can or cannot be used. Usually, the OSPO can work with the legal team to figure out what is or is not acceptable, but once there is a decision, it doesn’t need revisiting and becomes a matter of communicating to the entire organization what licenses are acceptable in which scenarios.

But what do organizations do once they have already organized their internal projects, developed frameworks for how to use and contribute to open source, and sufficiently addressed compliance?

## Overcoming internal obstacles: Culture and education

Once an OSPO has developed policies around using and contributing to open source, a common next step is to spread the word internally. This is not a trivial consideration, especially given that many OSPOs are only a handful of people in an organization with thousands or even tens of thousands of engineers. This internal communication role of the OSPO also goes back to one trigger for creating the OSPO in the first place: a large number of
queries coming from software engineers about how to relate to open source.

“When we are talking about contributing to open source software, in the beginning, the question we started with was, ‘are we even allowed to do that?’” said Schumacher, from DB Systel. People
just did not know what parameters there were about using,
and especially around contributing back to, open source. If one of the first-level goals of an OSPO is to figure out what those parameters are, the secondary goal is to make sure that there is a dissemination of knowledge throughout the organization.

According to Vlatko, from Wayfair, after setting up an organizational structure in GitHub and figuring out the license types that were acceptable for use, there was an educational campaign to ensure that information was widely known across the organization.

But aside from preemptively answering engineers’ questions about interacting with open source, there is an even larger shift in how people think about open source. “The question has changed a bit from whether or not to do open source to how to do open source strategically,” said Schumacher. “What I’m seeing now, after some time, is that we are looking more into the strategic part of how you can leverage open source, for example, in collaborations with external companies.”

Even though open source is everywhere, not all organizations have the culture around open source that they want, and opinions about open source are far from universally positive. Some people, from individual contributors to managers and executives, have had bad experiences with open source software or open source communities at some point in their careers, and convincing those people to embrace open source is part of the OSPO’s challenge.

 “We want to create a cultural mind shift and grow the community around open source,” said Abernathy, at F5. This will be a major driver in helping the company play a larger role in the open source ecosystem. In a real sense, OSPOs seek to improve open source’s reputation within the organization just as much as the organization’s reputation within the open source ecosystem.

## A strategic relationship with open source
There is no doubt that the strategic importance of open source varies depending on the type of company. For a company like Futurewei, open source alternatives to the “black box” solutions
it sells are a fundamental threat to the company’s ability to generate revenue. “And how you deal with this as a business, not a technology decision,” said Xie.

In a similar vein, VMware’s Ambiel stated, “At the end of the day, what does VMware do? We sell software. So, our open source investments need to align with our business aspirations.” The OSPO is there to make sure that happens.

At Spotify, there’s an ambition to spin out the company’s two most successful open source projects into separate business units that will launch commercial products based on the projects, turning the project from a cost center to a profit center. Part of the OSPO’s role at Spotify is to help identify and launch new projects that could potentially become new business units and support them in a way that increases the likelihood of success.
