# The OSPO journey

# OSPO之旅

The first step for many OSPOs, before they can begin to address more strategic concerns, is what many OSPO leaders described as cleaning up the mess of open source, recovering from years of ad hoc approaches to consuming and contributing to open source.

许多OSPO在解决更战略性的问题之前，第一步是清理开源混乱局面，纠正多年来随意使用开源和为开源做贡献的方式，这是许多OSPO领导者所描述的问题。

“We’ve had 10 years of publishing projects without a longer-term plan or formalized ownership,” said Ploug, of Spotify. The OSPO is currently going through all the projects that the company has created, figuring out who owns them—and making sure that ownership is assigned to a team, not an individual. There is also a process of determining which projects can be shut down, which requires confirming that there is no internal use.

“10年来，我们一直在发布项目，但却没有更长期的计划或正式的所有权”，Spotify的Ploug说。OSPO目前正在审查公司创建的所有项目，弄清楚谁拥有它们——确保所有权归属于一个团队，而不是个人。还有一个确定哪些项目可以关闭的流程，这需要确认内部没有在使用这些项目。

Other work that OSPOs often tackle initially is finite and can, at some point, be finished, such as the initial question about which licenses can or cannot be used. Usually, the OSPO can work with the legal team to figure out what is or is not acceptable, but once there is a decision, it doesn’t need revisiting and becomes a matter of communicating to the entire organization what licenses are acceptable in which scenarios.

OSPO最初经常处理的其他工作是有限的，某些情况下可以处理好一些初始问题，比如哪些许可证可以使用、哪些不行。通常，OSPO可以与法务团队合作，确定哪些是可接受的、哪些不是，而一旦做出决定，就不需要再次讨论，而是变成了一个与整个组织沟通的问题，即在哪些场景中可以接受哪些许可证。

But what do organizations do once they have already organized their internal projects, developed frameworks for how to use and contribute to open source, and sufficiently addressed compliance?

但是，当组织已经组织好了其内部项目，制定了如何使用开源和为开源做贡献的框架，并能充分解决合规问题时，它们该做什么呢？

## Overcoming internal obstacles: Culture and education

## 克服内部障碍：文化和教育

Once an OSPO has developed policies around using and contributing to open source, a common next step is to spread the word internally. This is not a trivial consideration, especially given that many OSPOs are only a handful of people in an organization with thousands or even tens of thousands of engineers. This internal communication role of the OSPO also goes back to one trigger for creating the OSPO in the first place: a large number of queries coming from software engineers about how to relate to open source.

一旦一个OSPO制定了关于使用开源和为开源做贡献的政策，通常要做的下一步是在内部传播这个信息。这不是容易考虑的事，特别是在许多OSPO只有寥寥数人而他们所处的组织有数千甚至数万名工程师的情况下。OSPO的这种内部沟通角色也可以追溯到最初创建OSPO的一个诱因：来自软件工程师关于如何了解开源的大量咨询。

“When we are talking about contributing to open source software, in the beginning, the question we started with was, ‘are we even allowed to do that?’” said Schumacher, from DB Systel. People just did not know what parameters there were about using, and especially around contributing back to, open source. If one of the first-level goals of an OSPO is to figure out what those parameters are, the secondary goal is to make sure that there is a dissemination of knowledge throughout the organization.

“当我们谈论为开源软件做贡献时，一开始我们要解决的问题是：‘我们是否被允许这样做？’”来自DB Systel的Schumacher说。人们不知道使用开源软件的规范是什么，特别是关于向开源软件做贡献的规范。如果OSPO的第一层目标是确定这些规范，那么第二层目标就是确保在整个组织中传播这些知识。

According to Vlatko, from Wayfair, after setting up an organizational structure in GitHub and figuring out the license types that were acceptable for use, there was an educational campaign to ensure that information was widely known across the organization.

据Wayfair的Vlatko所说，他们在GitHub上设置组织结构并确定了可接受使用的许可证类型后，进行了一项教育活动，以确保该信息在组织内得到广泛传播。

But aside from preemptively answering engineers’ questions about interacting with open source, there is an even larger shift in how people think about open source. “The question has changed a bit from whether or not to do open source to how to do open source strategically,” said Schumacher. “What I’m seeing now, after some time, is that we are looking more into the strategic part of how you can leverage open source, for example, in collaborations with external companies.”

但是除了预先回答工程师有关与开源互动的问题之外，人们对开源的看法发生了更大的变化。“问题已经从是否做开源转变为如何战略性地做开源”，Schumacher说，“在一段时间后，我现在看到的是我们正在更深入地研究如何战略性地利用开源，例如与外部公司合作。”

Even though open source is everywhere, not all organizations have the culture around open source that they want, and opinions about open source are far from universally positive. Some people, from individual contributors to managers and executives, have had bad experiences with open source software or open source communities at some point in their careers, and convincing those people to embrace open source is part of the OSPO’s challenge.

尽管开源无处不在，但并非所有组织都拥有他们想要的开源文化，对于开源的看法也远非普遍积极。有些人，无论是个人贡献者、经理还是高管，在职业生涯的某个阶段都曾经历过与开源软件或开源社区相关的负面经历，说服这些人拥抱开源是OSPO面临的挑战之一。

 “We want to create a cultural mind shift and grow the community around open source,” said Abernathy, at F5. This will be a major driver in helping the company play a larger role in the open source ecosystem. In a real sense, OSPOs seek to improve open source’s reputation within the organization just as much as the organization’s reputation within the open source ecosystem.

“我们希望促进文化思维的转变并扩大开源社区”，F5公司的Abernathy说。这将成为帮助公司在开源生态系统中发挥更大作用的重要驱动力。从实质上讲，OSPO试图提升开源在组织内部的声誉，这跟提升组织在开源生态系统内部的声誉一样重要。

## A strategic relationship with open source

## 与开源建立战略关系

There is no doubt that the strategic importance of open source varies depending on the type of company. For a company like Futurewei, open source alternatives to the “black box” solutions it sells are a fundamental threat to the company’s ability to generate revenue. “And how you deal with this as a business, not a technology decision,” said Xie.

毫无疑问，开源的战略重要性因公司类型而异。对于像Futurewei这样的公司来说，开源解决方案可以代替其销售的“黑盒”解决方案，这是一个根本性的威胁，可能影响其创收能力。“怎样解决这个问题是一项商业决策，而不是技术决策”，谢先生说。

In a similar vein, VMware’s Ambiel stated, “At the end of the day, what does VMware do? We sell software. So, our open source investments need to align with our business aspirations.” The OSPO is there to make sure that happens.

同样的，VMware的Ambiel表示，“归根结底，VMware是做什么的？我们销售软件。因此，我们的开源投资需要与我们的业务愿景保持一致。” OSPO的作用就是确保这一点。

At Spotify, there’s an ambition to spin out the company’s two most successful open source projects into separate business units that will launch commercial products based on the projects, turning the project from a cost center to a profit center. Part of the OSPO’s role at Spotify is to help identify and launch new projects that could potentially become new business units and support them in a way that increases the likelihood of success.

在Spotify，他们希望将公司最成功的两个开源项目分拆成单独的业务单元，基于这些项目推出商业产品，将项目从成本中心变成利润中心。OSPO在Spotify的角色之一是帮助识别和推出可能成为新业务单元的新项目，并以增加成功可能性的方式支持它们。
