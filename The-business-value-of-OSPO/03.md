# Introduction
## Why do we care about how OSPOs contribute to the business?

Why do we need to understand how OSPOs contribute to business goals? Whether it’s to advocate for creating a new OSPO, continue funding the OSPO, or even expand the OSPO, champions will ultimately have to connect the dots between the OSPO and business objectives. Whether in a for-profit business or not-for- profit university, no initiative that can’t be connected to outcomes that matter to the organization is likely to get greenlighted in the first place, nor survive if they can’t make a business case for their existence.

“OSPOs as a whole need to be nimble, they need to be always ready for the next change,” said Suzanne Ambiel, director of open source marketing and strategy at VMware. “They need to adapt
to the business because they’re serving the business as well as the community. As the business changes and morphs, the OSPO needs to do so as well ... It’s really important that an OSPO be very connected to the business and the business strategy.”

Though OSPOs are generally—but not always—located under the chief technology officer (CTO) and include many software engineers, interest in open source and how a company relates to open source is by no means limited to the engineering department. As we found in interviewing OSPO leaders for
this report, the OSPO champions in many organizations were executives who saw both opportunities and, in some cases, potential threats from open source that their companies needed to address strategically. In doing this research, we hope to better understand why open source matters strategically to companies and how OSPOs help organizations proactively manage both the opportunities and threats to their particular business from open source.

Hiro Fukuchi, senior alliance manager at Sony, gave an example of this executive interest: The OSPO organized a virtual event with an external expert that the company publicized, and many executives from both Japan and the United States attended.

## Common threads in unique stories
One of the challenges in conducting this research is that while there are certainly common threads, not only is each OSPO unique, but the stories behind their creation in the first place and how they contribute to the organization’s larger goals are also unique. So while we can certainly make some generalizations about why OSPOs matter, who tends to champion them, and how the business value of the OSPO tends to evolve, no two organizations are really alike.

“I was reading the Linux Foundation report that came out a couple of days ago, talking about the different OSPO structures,” said Christine Abernathy, senior director of open source at F5. “What I’ve learned is that they’re not all the same.” Just as OSPOs are all structured differently, there is a lot of diversity in their stated goals and the stories of how they came to be.1

## Methodology

For this report, we interviewed 12 OSPO leaders from Europe, Asia, and North America in a variety of industries, including two public universities. All the OSPO leaders interviewed are active in the TODO group. Here are the questions we started with:

• How many team members were on the OSPO at launch? How many are there now?
• What are the rough salary ranges for team members in the OSPO?
• What background do OSPO team members come from (e.g., engineering, legal, marketing)?
• What’s your industry?
• Where is the OSPO located in the organization (e.g.,engineering, legal, marketing)?
• Who was the initial champion for the OSPO?
• How did the champion(s) sell the OSPO internally? What did they say the value of the OSPO would be?
• What outcomes or KPIs were set for the OSPO when it was initially started?
• How has your understanding of the value of an OSPO, and the specific outcome you expect from your OSPO, changed over time?
• Do you expect to get the same business value out of your OSPO in the next five years, or do you expect the value of the OSPO to change?
• What metrics / measurements were collected to track your progress toward those outcomes? How have these metrics changed over time?
• What KPIs does your OSPO work toward now? How do you evaluate the OSPO’s success?


## Organization profiles and the relationship with open source

An organization’s relationship with open source, and therefore the value that it will get from an OSPO, does seem to depend on what type of company it is. Organizations that are fundamentally technology companies—whose revenue comes from selling hardware or software—experience both different opportunities and threats from open source than organizations whose revenue comes from selling furniture.

### Technology companies

For perhaps obvious reasons, companies whose revenue comes from selling hardware or software see the most direct relationship between open source and their business, and the OSPO is a critical part of managing that relationship.

“Pat Gelsinger, our CEO at the time,” said Ambiel, referring to who was one of the OSPO champions at VMware. “He’s the one who really leaned in and said, ‘We need to build an OPSO, we need to act with strategic intent.’”

The need for technology companies to approach open source strategically is a core reason they all gave for forming an OSPO. And while there was often executive involvement, it would be wrong to characterize OSPOs as a purely top-down initiative or one pushed by management on an unwilling team of engineers. Often individual open source enthusiasts within the companies would push for a more formalized relationship with open source at the same time that executives pushed for a more strategic approach. Creating an OSPO was the obvious next step to meet both stakeholders’ needs.

Open source wasn’t new at any of the companies we spoke with. They had all been using open source internally for years—and often had even open sourced internal projects in the past—
but they were becoming increasingly aware of how open source developers can be part of the adoption curve for their own products, and as a result, how important a decent reputation in the open source ecosystem can be.

“F5’s business has been moving from primarily hardware to software as a service,” said Abernathy. “A lot of the people who make purchasing decisions like to ‘try before they buy.’ These could be software developers who gravitate toward open source or even companies and governments who want to see your code in the open so that they can check the vulnerabilities.” So in the case of F5, open source is becoming important not just to how the company makes products but also to sales and marketing efforts. The OSPO is necessary to make sure F5 can leverage open source strategically and make informed decisions in situations where open source is relevant.

Abernathy, who previously worked in the open source office at Facebook (now Meta), outlined the difference between open source at a place like Facebook and a company like F5. “At Facebook, open source is important,” she said. “But not, like, in terms of revenue. They’re not building an open source product .... So here, it’s easier to start thinking about the ROI of open source in a more direct and meaningful way.”

In the case of F5, a major trigger for creating the OSPO was the acquisition of open source company Nginx in 2019. The acquisition meant that the Nginx team both joined F5 and became another voice pushing for an OSPO, which also increased the strategic importance of open source.

For companies like Aiven, whose core business is tightly related to an open source project or projects, a formalized and strategic approach to open source is perhaps even more critical—but something they still often lack without an OSPO. Josep Prat, open source engineering director at Aiven, said that even given the strategic importance of open source, there was always tension between a need to ship product features and a need to contribute back to open source. When there was an expectation for
engineers to contribute to open source in addition to all their other responsibilities, open source contributions would always take a back seat. Because of this tension, Aiven’s executive team decided very early on that there should be a dedicated OSPO whose sole job was to contribute to open source and manage the relationship with the open source communities.

In no way is it only open source companies or startups who feel like open source is of massive strategic importance. Chris Xie, head of open source strategy at Futurewei, the U.S.-based research and development arm of Huawei, stated that the company has been aware of both the threat and opportunities from open source for more than two decades, and the OSPO is part of how the company approaches both the threats and opportunities from open source.

### End user companies

After the pure technology companies, there are the tech- forward companies who want to emulate many of what they see happening at pure technology companies, especially in
terms of software development. These are companies that get their revenue from something other than selling hardware or software, and who wouldn’t say that building either is particularly core to their business. However, technology is critical to their business operations, and they share a desire to be perceived as a technology company as a means to attract top talent and create new revenue streams. One pattern that appears among these companies is that the OSPO and contributing to open source
and releasing open source projects are all part of an effort to change the perception of the company as well as to improve the organization’s ability to deliver high-quality software, faster.

“Spotify has been using and creating open source since the very beginning, but at the same time, we didn’t approach it in a strategic way or consider how it created value for the company,” said Per Ploug, OSPO lead at Spotify. “It is critical for us that open
source work is elevated to the same level as internal work, so we consider why we do it and how it brings value, so we ensure our engineers invest their time in projects which have impact.”

In Spotify’s case, the most visible example of this new approach is Backstage, the company’s big bet on building a commercial offering on top of the successful open source project they donated to the CNCF in 2020. Spotify intends to make their investment
into Backstage more self-sustainable and to ensure they stay engaged in the open source community long term. Right now, they have more than 40 people working on Backstage. We have very ambitious plans for Backstage, which include a commercial strategy that can both fund those ambitions and result in a better end product for everyone. The goal is to move open source from a cost center to a profit center.

“Wayfair is a tech company, and it takes the continuous work of many technologists across numerous disciplines to support our operations and growth,” said Natali Vlatko, global lead, OSPO at Wayfair. “In chats with our former CTO, I stressed that the easiest way for us to genuinely and authentically live that mindset is to build technical products. The surefire way to do that is to build open source and invest back into the open source ecosystem.”

While becoming more tech-company-like is certainly a goal for these companies, it remains a means to an end. In some cases, the ends are clear, and it is often being able to hire the best talent as well as improve the quality of the engineering work in-house. Sometimes, though, even these companies start out believing that open source matters but are unable to articulate exactly
why or how open source contributes to engineering or business objectives. The establishment of the OSPO helps them clarify how open source is already benefiting the company and determine how to get even more value from open source.

“They had a couple of open source projects that didn’t go anywhere,” said Duane O’Brien, director of open source at Indeed, about what was going on at the company before he joined. No one thought they were massive successes. “I don’t think they had a clear picture of what success meant for themselves,” he said.


### Universities

For universities, the value of open source and the related value of an OSPO to oversee the relationship between open source
and researchers at the university is different from for-profit companies. However, they often see open source as a way to further the university’s mission—an opportunity that until very recently was largely missed. “They don’t really have a history of being engaged in open source,” said Carlos Maltzahn, director of the Center for Research in Open Source Software at the University of California Santa Cruz. As a matter of fact, he said, while there have been successful open source projects that have originated
at a university, in many cases, it’s been a personal project of an individual student or researcher because most universities have little to no support for turning research products into high-impact open source contributions. That’s something he’d like to change and sees the OSPO as a way to support students and researchers who create open source projects and help more projects cross the chasm from a graduate student research project to something used in the wider ecosystem.

For Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona, professor at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid and head of their open knowledge efforts, open source fits into the larger mission related to expanding access to knowledge. “In all of Europe, especially in Spain, universities are rediscovering this idea that we need to produce knowledge for society,” he said. Open source software, but also open access to research, is a way to fulfill this mission.
