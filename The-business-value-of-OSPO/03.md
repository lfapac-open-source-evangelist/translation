Why do we need to understand how OSPOs contribute to business goals? Whether it’s to advocate for creating a new OSPO, continue funding the OSPO, or even expand the OSPO, champions will ultimately have to connect the dots between the OSPO and business objectives. Whether in a for-profit business or not-for- profit university, no initiative that can’t be connected to outcomes that matter to the organization is likely to get greenlighted in the first place, nor survive if they can’t make a business case for their existence.

为什么我们需要了解OSPO如何对业务目标提供助力？无论是为了倡导创建新的OSPO、继续为OSPO提供资金支持，还是为了扩大OSPO，支持者最终必须将OSPO与业务目标联系起来。无论是在营利性企业还是非营利性大学，如果一项提议不能与组织关心的结果联系起来，很可能首先就不会得到批准。如果不能为它们的存在提出商业理由，它们也无法生存下去。

“OSPOs as a whole need to be nimble, they need to be always ready for the next change,” said Suzanne Ambiel, director of open source marketing and strategy at VMware. “They need to adapt to the business because they’re serving the business as well as the community. As the business changes and morphs, the OSPO needs to do so as well ... It’s really important that an OSPO be very connected to the business and the business strategy.”

”整个OSPO需要保持敏捷性，始终准备着应对下一个变化“，VMware开源营销和战略主管Suzanne Ambiel表示。”他们需要适应业务，因为他们同时服务于业务和社区。随着业务的变化和发展，OSPO也需要进行相应的调整……一个OSPO与业务和业务战略紧密相连是非常重要的。“

Though OSPOs are generally—but not always—located under the chief technology officer (CTO) and include many software engineers, interest in open source and how a company relates to open source is by no means limited to the engineering department. As we found in interviewing OSPO leaders for this report, the OSPO champions in many organizations were executives who saw both opportunities and, in some cases, potential threats from open source that their companies needed to address strategically. In doing this research, we hope to better understand why open source matters strategically to companies and how OSPOs help organizations proactively manage both the opportunities and threats to their particular business from open source.

虽然OSPO通常（但并非总是）隶属于首席技术官(CTO)，并且由许多软件工程师组成，但并不是只有工程部门才对开源及公司如何与开源相关联感兴趣。正如我们在采访本报告的OSPO领导者时发现的，许多组织中的OSPO倡导者是高管，他们看到了开源带来的机会，也看到了某些情况下开源所带来的潜在威胁，他们的公司需要从战略层面解决好这些问题。通过进行这项研究，我们希望更好地理解为什么开源对公司具有战略意义，以及OSPO如何帮助组织积极管理开源给其特定业务所带来的机遇和威胁。

Hiro Fukuchi, senior alliance manager at Sony, gave an example of this executive interest: The OSPO organized a virtual event with an external expert that the company publicized, and many executives from both Japan and the United States attended.

索尼公司高级联盟经理Hiro Fukuchi举出了一个这种高管对开源有兴趣的案例：OSPO组织了一场虚拟活动，并邀请了一位外部专家参加，该公司对此进行了宣传后，来自日本和美国的许多高管都参加了这次活动。

## Common threads in unique stories

## 独特故事中的共同线索

One of the challenges in conducting this research is that while there are certainly common threads, not only is each OSPO unique, but the stories behind their creation in the first place and how they contribute to the organization’s larger goals are also unique. So while we can certainly make some generalizations about why OSPOs matter, who tends to champion them, and how the business value of the OSPO tends to evolve, no two organizations are really alike.

进行这项研究的一个挑战是，虽然肯定存在共同的线索，但每个OSPO都是独特的，而且它们在第一次创建时的故事以及它们如何为组织的更大目标提供助力也都是独特的。因此，尽管我们肯定可以对OSPO的重要性、谁倾向于支持它们以及OSPO的业务价值如何发展做出一些概括，但真正的情况是没有两个组织是完全相同的。

“I was reading the Linux Foundation report that came out a couple of days ago, talking about the different OSPO structures,” said Christine Abernathy, senior director of open source at F5. “What I’ve learned is that they’re not all the same.” Just as OSPOs are all structured differently, there is a lot of diversity in their stated goals and the stories of how they came to be.1

“我正在阅读几天前发布的Linux基金会报告，该报告谈到了不同的OSPO结构”，F5的开源高级总监Christine Abernathy说。“我所学到的是，它们并不都是相同的。”正如OSPO结构都各不相同，它们的既定目标和它们如何成立的故事也存在很多差异。[^1]

## Organization profiles and the relationship with open source

## 组织概况及其与开源的关系

An organization’s relationship with open source, and therefore the value that it will get from an OSPO, does seem to depend on what type of company it is. Organizations that are fundamentally technology companies—whose revenue comes from selling hardware or software—experience both different opportunities and threats from open source than organizations whose revenue comes from selling furniture.

组织与开源的关系，以及它因此将从OSPO获得的价值，似乎取决于它是什么类型的公司。本质上是技术公司的组织——其收入来自于销售硬件或软件——从开源中获得的机会和受到的威胁与收入来自于销售家具的组织有所不同。

### Technology companies

### 技术公司

For perhaps obvious reasons, companies whose revenue comes from selling hardware or software see the most direct relationship between open source and their business, and the OSPO is a critical part of managing that relationship.

因为种种显而易见的原因，从销售硬件或软件中获得收益的公司最直接地感受到开源和它们业务之间的关系，OSPO是管理这种关系的关键部分。

“Pat Gelsinger, our CEO at the time,” said Ambiel, referring to who was one of the OSPO champions at VMware. “He’s the one who really leaned in and said, ‘We need to build an OPSO, we need to act with strategic intent.’”

“我们当时的CEO是Pat Gelsinger”，Ambiel指的是VMware的一个OSPO倡导者。“他是真正投入的人，他说，‘我们需要建立一个OSPO，我们需要根据战略意图来行动。’”

The need for technology companies to approach open source strategically is a core reason they all gave for forming an OSPO. And while there was often executive involvement, it would be wrong to characterize OSPOs as a purely top-down initiative or one pushed by management on an unwilling team of engineers. Often individual open source enthusiasts within the companies would push for a more formalized relationship with open source at the same time that executives pushed for a more strategic approach. Creating an OSPO was the obvious next step to meet both stakeholders’ needs.

技术公司需要从战略上对待开源是他们组建OSPO的核心原因。虽然经常有高管参与其中，但不能将OSPO视为纯粹的自上而下的计划，或者是一个由管理层强行推动不情愿参与的工程师形成的团队。通常，在公司内部有一些开源个人爱好者会推动更正式的开源关系，与此同时高管们则推行更具战略性的方法。创建OSPO显然是满足利益双方需求的下一步。

Open source wasn’t new at any of the companies we spoke with. They had all been using open source internally for years—and often had even open sourced internal projects in the past—but they were becoming increasingly aware of how open source developers can be part of the adoption curve for their own products, and as a result, how important a decent reputation in the open source ecosystem can be.

在我们采访的所有公司中，开源并不是什么新鲜事。它们一直在内部使用开源——并且通常甚至过去已经开源过内部项目——但它们越来越意识到，开源开发人员可以成为其产品使用曲线的一部分。因此，在开源生态系统中拥有良好的声誉非常重要。

“F5’s business has been moving from primarily hardware to software as a service,” said Abernathy. “A lot of the people who make purchasing decisions like to ‘try before they buy.’ These could be software developers who gravitate toward open source or even companies and governments who want to see your code in the open so that they can check the vulnerabilities.” So in the case of F5, open source is becoming important not just to how the company makes products but also to sales and marketing efforts. The OSPO is necessary to make sure F5 can leverage open source strategically and make informed decisions in situations where open source is relevant.

“F5的业务正在从主要的硬件转向软件即服务”，Abernathy说，“许多决定购买的人喜欢‘试用后再购买’。他们可能是倾向于开源的软件开发人员，甚至是希望在开放环境中查看代码以检查漏洞的公司和政府人员。” 因此，在F5这种情况下，开源不仅对公司的产品制造方式至关重要，也对销售和营销工作至关重要。为了确保F5能够战略性地利用开源，并在与开源相关的情况下做出明智的决策，OSPO是必要的。

Abernathy, who previously worked in the open source office at Facebook (now Meta), outlined the difference between open source at a place like Facebook and a company like F5. “At Facebook, open source is important,” she said. “But not, like, in terms of revenue. They’re not building an open source product .... So here, it’s easier to start thinking about the ROI of open source in a more direct and meaningful way.”

之前在Facebook（现在是Meta）的开源办公室工作的Abernathy概述了在Facebook和F5这样的公司中的开源之间的区别。“在Facebook，开源很重要”，她说，“但不是在收入方面。他们没有构建开源产品……所以在这里，更容易开始以更直接和有意义的方式考虑开源的投资回报。”

In the case of F5, a major trigger for creating the OSPO was the acquisition of open source company Nginx in 2019. The acquisition meant that the Nginx team both joined F5 and became another voice pushing for an OSPO, which also increased the strategic importance of open source.

在F5这种情况下，创建OSPO的一个主要诱因是在2019年收购了开源公司Nginx。这次收购意味着Nginx团队加入了F5，并成为另一个推动OSPO的声音，增加了开源的战略重要性。

For companies like Aiven, whose core business is tightly related to an open source project or projects, a formalized and strategic approach to open source is perhaps even more critical—but something they still often lack without an OSPO. Josep Prat, open source engineering director at Aiven, said that even given the strategic importance of open source, there was always tension between a need to ship product features and a need to contribute back to open source. When there was an expectation for engineers to contribute to open source in addition to all their other responsibilities, open source contributions would always take a back seat. Because of this tension, Aiven’s executive team decided very early on that there should be a dedicated OSPO whose sole job was to contribute to open source and manage the relationship with the open source communities.

对于Aiven这样核心业务与一个或多个开源项目紧密相关的公司来说，正式地、战略性地走向开源的途径可能更为关键，但通常在没有OSPO的情况下他们仍然缺少这个途径。Aiven的开源工程总监Josep Prat表示，尽管开源的战略重要性很高，但在推出产品功能和回馈开源这两个需求之间总是存在紧张关系。当期望工程师除了履行所有其他职责之外，还要为开源做出贡献时，开源贡献总是被放在次要位置。因此，Aiven的高管团队很早就决定应该有一个专门的OSPO，其唯一的工作就是为开源做出贡献，并管理与开源社区的关系。

In no way is it only open source companies or startups who feel like open source is of massive strategic importance. Chris Xie, head of open source strategy at Futurewei, the U.S.-based research and development arm of Huawei, stated that the company has been aware of both the threat and opportunities from open source for more than two decades, and the OSPO is part of how the company approaches both the threats and opportunities from open source.

并不仅仅是开源公司或初创企业认为开源具有重大战略意义。华为美国研发部门未来维（Futurewei）的开源战略负责人Chris Xie表示，20多年来，公司一直清楚开源带来的威胁和机遇，而OSPO是公司应对开源威胁和机遇的举措之一。

### End user companies
### 终端用户公司

After the pure technology companies, there are the tech-forward companies who want to emulate many of what they see happening at pure technology companies, especially in terms of software development. These are companies that get their revenue from something other than selling hardware or software, and who wouldn’t say that building either is particularly core to their business. However, technology is critical to their business operations, and they share a desire to be perceived as a technology company as a means to attract top talent and create new revenue streams. One pattern that appears among these companies is that the OSPO and contributing to open source and releasing open source projects are all part of an effort to change the perception of the company as well as to improve the organization’s ability to deliver high-quality software, faster.

在纯技术公司之后，是那些希望效仿纯技术公司做法（尤其是在软件开发方面）的前沿技术企业。这些公司的收入不是来源于销售硬件或软件，而且他们也不会说构建硬件或软件是他们特别核心的业务。然而，技术对他们的业务运营至关重要，他们希望被视为技术公司，以吸引顶尖人才和创造新的收入来源。这些公司之间出现的一个模式是，OSPO、为开源做贡献和发布开源项目都是为改变公司形象以及提升组织能够更快地交付高质量软件的能力而做出的努力的一部分。

“Spotify has been using and creating open source since the very beginning, but at the same time, we didn’t approach it in a strategic way or consider how it created value for the company,” said Per Ploug, OSPO lead at Spotify. “It is critical for us that open source work is elevated to the same level as internal work, so we consider why we do it and how it brings value, so we ensure our engineers invest their time in projects which have impact.”

“从一开始起，Spotify就一直在使用和创建开源软件，但同时，我们并没有从战略的角度看待它，也没有考虑它如何为公司创造价值，”Spotify的OSPO负责人Per Ploug表示，“对我们来说，将开源工作提升到与内部工作同等的水平是至关重要的，因此我们会考虑为什么要这样做以及它如何带来价值，从而确保我们的工程师将时间投入到具有影响力的项目中。”

In Spotify’s case, the most visible example of this new approach is Backstage, the company’s big bet on building a commercial offering on top of the successful open source project they donated to the CNCF in 2020. Spotify intends to make their investment into Backstage more self-sustainable and to ensure they stay engaged in the open source community long term. Right now, they have more than 40 people working on Backstage. We have very ambitious plans for Backstage, which include a commercial strategy that can both fund those ambitions and result in a better end product for everyone. The goal is to move open source from a cost center to a profit center.

在Spotify的案例中，这种新做法最显著的例子是Backstage，这是该公司在一个成功的开源项目基础上大胆建立的商业产品，而这个开源项目是由该公司在2020年捐赠给CNCF的。Spotify打算让他们对Backstage的投资更加可持续，并确保他们长期参与开源社区。目前，他们有40多人在开发Backstage。我们为Backstage制定了雄心勃勃的计划，其中包括一项商业策略，既可以为这些雄心提供资金，又能为每个人带来更好的最终产品。其目标是将开源从成本中心转变为利润中心。

“Wayfair is a tech company, and it takes the continuous work of many technologists across numerous disciplines to support our operations and growth,” said Natali Vlatko, global lead, OSPO at Wayfair. “In chats with our former CTO, I stressed that the easiest way for us to genuinely and authentically live that mindset is to build technical products. The surefire way to do that is to build open source and invest back into the open source ecosystem.”

“Wayfair是一家技术公司，需要许多不同领域的大量技术人员持续工作来支持我们的运营和增长，”Wayfair的OSPO全球负责人Natali Vlatko说，“在与我们的前任CTO交谈中，我强调过，对我们来说，真正、真实地实现这种理念的最简单方法就是构建技术产品。确保做到这一点的方法是构建开源并回馈开源生态系统。”

While becoming more tech-company-like is certainly a goal for these companies, it remains a means to an end. In some cases, the ends are clear, and it is often being able to hire the best talent as well as improve the quality of the engineering work in-house. Sometimes, though, even these companies start out believing that open source matters but are unable to articulate exactly why or how open source contributes to engineering or business objectives. The establishment of the OSPO helps them clarify how open source is already benefiting the company and determine how to get even more value from open source.

尽管变得更像技术公司肯定是这些公司的目标，但它仍然是达到目的的手段。在某些情况下，目的是明确的，通常是为了能够聘请最好的人才以及提高内部工程工作的质量。但有时，即使这些公司开始相信开源很重要，却无法清楚地阐明开源为什么会或如何为工程或业务目标提供助力。OSPO的建立有助于他们澄清开源是如何使公司受益的，并确定如何从开源中获得更多价值。

“They had a couple of open source projects that didn’t go anywhere,” said Duane O’Brien, director of open source at Indeed, about what was going on at the company before he joined. No one thought they were massive successes. “I don’t think they had a clear picture of what success meant for themselves,” he said.

“他们有一些开源项目没有得到推广，”Indeed的开源主管Duane O’Brien提到他加入之前公司的情况时说。没有人认为它们是非常成功的项目。他说：“我认为他们对自己的成功没有清晰的认识。”

For universities, the value of open source and the related value of an OSPO to oversee the relationship between open source and researchers at the university is different from for-profit companies. However, they often see open source as a way to further the university’s mission—an opportunity that until very recently was largely missed. “They don’t really have a history of being engaged in open source,” said Carlos Maltzahn, director of the Center for Research in Open Source Software at the University of California Santa Cruz. As a matter of fact, he said, while there have been successful open source projects that have originated at a university, in many cases, it’s been a personal project of an individual student or researcher because most universities have little to no support for turning research products into high-impact open source contributions. That’s something he’d like to change and sees the OSPO as a way to support students and researchers who create open source projects and help more projects cross the chasm from a graduate student research project to something used in the wider ecosystem.

对于大学而言，开源的价值和OSPO管理开源和大学研究人员之间关系的相关价值与营利性公司不同。然而，他们通常把开源看作是进一步推进大学使命的一种方式——这是直到最近才被广泛认识到的机遇。“他们真的没有参与开源的历史”，加利福尼亚大学圣克鲁兹分校开源软件研究中心的主任Carlos Maltzahn说。事实上，他说，虽然有一些成功的开源项目起源于大学，但在许多情况下，这是学生或研究人员的个人项目，因为大多数大学几乎没有任何资源支持可以把研究成果转化为具有重大影响力的开源贡献。他希望改变这种情况，他将OSPO视为支持创建开源项目的学生和研究人员的方式，以帮助更多项目跨越鸿沟，从研究生的研究项目到更广泛的生态系统中的应用。

For Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona, professor at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid and head of their open knowledge efforts, open source fits into the larger mission related to expanding access to knowledge. “In all of Europe, especially in Spain, universities are rediscovering this idea that we need to produce knowledge for society,” he said. Open source software, but also open access to research, is a way to fulfill this mission.

对于作为马德里的胡安·卡洛斯国王大学的教授和他们开放知识项目负责人的Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona而言，开源符合与扩大知识获取途径相关的更大使命。他说:“在整个欧洲，特别是在西班牙，大学正在重新发现我们需要为社会生产知识的这个想法。” 开源软件，以及研究的开放获取，是实现这一使命的方式。
