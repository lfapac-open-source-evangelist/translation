Open source software continues to transform how entire industries create and use software. Across industries, systems built to a large degree or even entirely from open source software components that communicate via open APIs are replacing
proprietary and closed software stacks. Based on collaboration and joint development, open source software has become a fundamental means for driving innovation, fostering technology adoption, and openly sharing knowledge.

开源软件继续改变着整个行业创建和使用软件的方式。在各个行业中，在很大程度上甚至完全由通过开放API沟通的开源软件组件构建的系统正在取代专有和封闭的软件堆栈。基于协作和联合开发，开源软件已成为推动创新、促进技术采用和公开共享知识的基本手段。

While the high-level advantages of open source software are
undeniable, it is unfortunately far from simple and straightforward
for organizations to leverage those in practice. As the usage of
open source software in organizations proliferates and matures,
many realize the need for establishing a structured approach to
working with open source software. Initially, this need typically
emerges from license compliance concerns, but it quickly grows
way beyond compliance alone, eventually encompassing business
strategy aspects as well.

尽管开源软件的顶层优势是不可否认的，但不幸的是，组织在实践中使用它们远非这么简单直接的事情。随着开源软件在组织中的使用激增和成熟，许多人意识到需要建立一种结构化的方法来使用开源软件。最初，这种需求通常源于许可证合规性问题，但它很快就远远超出了合规性本身，最终也涵盖了商业战略方面。

This report compiles the results of a survey among open source
advocates from Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) across
various companies and universities. It provides a broad insight into
the motivation behind forming OSPOs and the concrete business
value of OSPOs to their respective organizations.

本报告汇集了来自不同公司和大学的开源项目办公室（OSPO）的开源倡导者的调查结果。它为形成OSPO背后的动机以及OSPOs对其各自组织的具体商业价值提供了广泛的视角。

It turns out that, just like open source software itself, OSPOs
come in all sorts of shapes and forms. However, irrespective of
the concrete implementation of an OSPO, the survey shows that
across organizations, the key business value of OSPOs converges
toward the same fundamental goals: to establish a framework
for an organization’s way of working with open source software
and to ensure that open source software is leveraged strategically
and well aligned with an organization’s business goals. An OSPO’s
responsibilities thereby range from formalizing processes and
transforming an organization’s culture to guiding the creation and
execution of a long-term open source strategy.

Building on the core principles of open source software—
collaboration and knowledge sharing—the contributors to this
report aim to provide a helpful source of information. It targets
both open source champions in organizations who are currently
on the journey of establishing an OSPO as well as open source
leaders of existing OSPOs, enabling them to clearly define,
measure, and communicate the business value of an OSPO.

事实证明，就像开源软件本身一样，OSPO有各种各样的形态和方式。然而，无论OSPO的具体实施情况如何，调查显示，在各个组织中，OSPO的关键业务价值指向了相同的基本目标：为组织使用开源软件的方式建立一个框架，并确保开源软件在战略上得到利用，并与组织的业务目标保持一致。因此，OSPO的职责范围从正式化流程和转变组织文化到指导长期开源战略的创建和执行。

基于开源软件协作和知识共享的核心原则，本报告的撰稿人旨在提供有用的信息来源。它既针对目前正在建立OSPO的组织中的开源拥护者，也针对现有OSPO的开源领导者，使他们能够清楚地定义、衡量和传达OSPO的商业价值。

As open source software has achieved ubiquity in the technology
arena, more organizations are realizing the benefits of working
with open source projects and the communities that build
them. To harness this strategic potential of open source, direct
investment into engaging with project communities is no longer
a nice to have but a requirement. OSPOs, once largely extant
only at large technology-focused firms, have proliferated across
industries as a locus for starting, standardizing, and scaling an
organization’s approach to open source.

随着开源软件在技术领域的普及，越来越多的组织正在意识到与开源项目和构建这些项目的社区合作的好处。为了利用开源的这种战略潜力，直接投资参与项目社区不再是一件好事，而是一种要求。OSPO曾经主要只存在于以技术为重点的大型公司，现在已经在各个行业激增，成为启动、标准化和扩展组织开源方法的场所。

In just the past five years, we have seen OSPOs crop up in
the fields of automotive, entertainment, financial services,
manufacturing, and even within academia and government
bodies. Having an OSPO and accompanying dedicated resources
to focus a company’s open source strategy creates a framework
for harnessing the best possible outcomes for all players involved.
Organizations have a clearer view of the software landscape
upon which their businesses depend, maintainers of key software
projects have a more direct line into organizations using their
works, and external would-be collaborators have a welcoming and
well-understood entry point to negotiating with the business.

In this report, you will hear from OSPO leaders across a variety
of sectors who will share their journey building open source
consumption, contribution, and community engagement
strategies for their businesses. You will also learn that each
OSPO’s goals, success metrics, and approaches to engagement
vary depending upon the drivers for establishing the OSPO, an
organization’s maturity level with their open source practice, and
how internal champions for the OSPO’s work support its growth
and strategy. No OSPO is exactly like another, even as they share
many common responsibilities.

在过去的五年里，我们看到OSPO在汽车、娱乐、金融服务、制造业领域，甚至在学术界和政府机构中涌现。拥有一个OSPO和相应的专用资源来专注于公司的开源战略，为所有参与者创造了一个利用最佳结果的框架。组织对其业务所依赖的软件环境有了更清晰的了解，关键软件项目的维护者可以更直接地进入使用其作品的组织，外部潜在合作者在与业务谈判时有一个受欢迎且广为人知的切入点。

在本报告中，您将听到来自各个行业的OSPO领导人的发言，他们将分享他们为企业建立开源消费、贡献和社区参与战略的历程。您还将了解到，每个OSPO的目标、成功指标和参与方法都有所不同，这取决于建立OSPO的驱动因素、组织在开源实践方面的成熟度水平，以及OSPO工作的内部支持者如何支持其发展和战略。没有一个OSPO与另一个完全相同，尽管它们有许多共同的责任。

Across our combined 30+ years of experience working in open
source, the common thread we’ve seen that unites all OSPOs
is their deep value in enabling collaboration and co-creation,
whether that’s internally amongst different software teams or
competitors working together in an upstream community. OSPOs
are one of the few teams with a clear mandate for bi-directional
advocacy, both within the organization— establishing norms for
engaging with open source projects and championing open source
best practices—and externally to the organization, ensuring that a
company’s actions in a particular community both serve business
goals and advance the technical state of the art for all players.

It is precisely because of the flexibility and bi-directional nature
of the OSPO’s mission that these groups can be the foundational
strategic lynchpin of a business’s technology approach. OSPOs
have the freedom to explore and support innovations for the
business and to define how this engagement will work to best
satisfy the objectives of all players, from engineering talent to
business executives to the open source project community itself.
OSPOs act as the conduit and connective tissue between each
group of stakeholders, diplomatically ensuring the interests of
all parties are heard and considered, and negotiating for the best
possible outcomes for all parties collaborating and co-creating
together.

在我们30多年的开源工作经验中，我们看到的将所有OSPO团结在一起的共同点是，无论是在不同的软件团队内部，还是在上游社区中合作的竞争对手之间，它们在实现协作和共同创建方面都有着深刻的价值。OSPO是少数几个明确授权双向倡导的团队之一，无论是在组织内部，还是在组织外部，都要建立参与开源项目和倡导开源最佳实践的规范，确保公司在特定社区的行动既有助于实现商业目标，又能提高所有参与者的技术水平。

正是由于OSPO使命的灵活性和双向性，这些团体可以成为企业技术方法的基本战略关键。OSPO可以自由探索和支持业务创新，并定义这种参与将如何最好地满足所有参与者的目标，从工程人才到企业高管，再到开源项目社区本身。OSPO充当每组利益相关者之间的管道和连接组织，在外交上确保各方的利益得到倾听和考虑，并为各方合作和共同创造尽可能好的结果进行谈判。

It is this inward and outward-facing service mission that is the
real magic of the OSPO. In this role, the successful OSPO acts as
a diplomat for its organization in the wider world, charged with
representing the needs of the business to the community and
the community’s needs to the business. OSPOs have a unique
role to play as stewards of industry-wide best practices, a locus of
collaboration and co-creation, and a conduit for change agency as
their company evolves in the ever-changing market landscape.

For those who have worked in the open source space for the
past decades, or for readers who are early in their open source
journeys, this whitepaper will present key areas of challenge and
opportunity for the OSPO, shared from senior OSPO leaders
across a variety of industries. Wherever you may be in your OSPO
journey, from having one lone staffer who focuses on open source
software license compliance to having a long-established open 
source strategy, we hope you will find this research valuable in
examining the business value of OSPOs for your enterprise. As
you examine the findings from open source leaders in a variety
of industries, we hope you will see yourself in their journeys
and be inspired. We look forward to your organization joining
the community of OSPO practitioners contributing to the very
foundations of open source practice: how we work together, what
we do together, and how we all can derive mutual benefit.

正是这种内向和外向的服务使命才是OSPO真正的魔力。在这一角色中，成功的OSPO作为其组织在更广泛世界的外交官，负责代表社区对企业的需求和企业对社区的需求。随着公司在不断变化的市场格局中的发展，OSPOs作为全行业最佳实践的管理者、合作和共同创造的场所以及变革机构的渠道，可以发挥独特的作用。

对于那些在过去几十年中一直在开源领域工作的人，或者处于开源之旅早期的读者，本白皮书将介绍OSPO面临的挑战和机遇的关键领域，并由各个行业的OSPO高级领导人分享。无论您身处OSPO之旅哪个阶段，从拥有一名专注于开源软件许可证合规性的员工，到拥有一个长期建立的开源策略，我们希望您能发现这项研究对检验OSPO对您的企业的商业价值有价值。当你审视各个行业开源领导者的发现时，我们希望你能在他们的旅程中看到自己，并受到启发。我们期待您的组织加入OSPO从业者的社区，为开源实践的基础做出贡献：我们如何合作，我们一起做什么，以及我们如何获得互利。
