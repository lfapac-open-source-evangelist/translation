Open source software continues to transform how entire industries create and use software. Across industries, systems built to a large degree or even entirely from open source software components that communicate via open APIs are replacing
proprietary and closed software stacks. Based on collaboration and joint development, open source software has become a fundamental means for driving innovation, fostering technology adoption, and openly sharing knowledge.

While the high-level advantages of open source software are
undeniable, it is unfortunately far from simple and straightforward
for organizations to leverage those in practice. As the usage of
open source software in organizations proliferates and matures,
many realize the need for establishing a structured approach to
working with open source software. Initially, this need typically
emerges from license compliance concerns, but it quickly grows
way beyond compliance alone, eventually encompassing business
strategy aspects as well.

This report compiles the results of a survey among open source
advocates from Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) across
various companies and universities. It provides a broad insight into
the motivation behind forming OSPOs and the concrete business
value of OSPOs to their respective organizations.

It turns out that, just like open source software itself, OSPOs
come in all sorts of shapes and forms. However, irrespective of
the concrete implementation of an OSPO, the survey shows that
across organizations, the key business value of OSPOs converges
toward the same fundamental goals: to establish a framework
for an organization’s way of working with open source software
and to ensure that open source software is leveraged strategically
and well aligned with an organization’s business goals. An OSPO’s
responsibilities thereby range from formalizing processes and
transforming an organization’s culture to guiding the creation and
execution of a long-term open source strategy.

Building on the core principles of open source software—
collaboration and knowledge sharing—the contributors to this
report aim to provide a helpful source of information. It targets
both open source champions in organizations who are currently
on the journey of establishing an OSPO as well as open source
leaders of existing OSPOs, enabling them to clearly define,
measure, and communicate the business value of an OSPO.

As open source software has achieved ubiquity in the technology
arena, more organizations are realizing the benefits of working
with open source projects and the communities that build
them. To harness this strategic potential of open source, direct
investment into engaging with project communities is no longer
a nice to have but a requirement. OSPOs, once largely extant
only at large technology-focused firms, have proliferated across
industries as a locus for starting, standardizing, and scaling an
organization’s approach to open source.

In just the past five years, we have seen OSPOs crop up in
the fields of automotive, entertainment, financial services,
manufacturing, and even within academia and government
bodies. Having an OSPO and accompanying dedicated resources
to focus a company’s open source strategy creates a framework
for harnessing the best possible outcomes for all players involved.
Organizations have a clearer view of the software landscape
upon which their businesses depend, maintainers of key software
projects have a more direct line into organizations using their
works, and external would-be collaborators have a welcoming and
well-understood entry point to negotiating with the business.

In this report, you will hear from OSPO leaders across a variety
of sectors who will share their journey building open source
consumption, contribution, and community engagement
strategies for their businesses. You will also learn that each
OSPO’s goals, success metrics, and approaches to engagement
vary depending upon the drivers for establishing the OSPO, an
organization’s maturity level with their open source practice, and
how internal champions for the OSPO’s work support its growth
and strategy. No OSPO is exactly like another, even as they share
many common responsibilities.

Across our combined 30+ years of experience working in open
source, the common thread we’ve seen that unites all OSPOs
is their deep value in enabling collaboration and co-creation,
whether that’s internally amongst different software teams or
competitors working together in an upstream community. OSPOs
are one of the few teams with a clear mandate for bi-directional
advocacy, both within the organization— establishing norms for
engaging with open source projects and championing open source
best practices—and externally to the organization, ensuring that a
company’s actions in a particular community both serve business
goals and advance the technical state of the art for all players.

It is precisely because of the flexibility and bi-directional nature
of the OSPO’s mission that these groups can be the foundational
strategic lynchpin of a business’s technology approach. OSPOs
have the freedom to explore and support innovations for the
business and to define how this engagement will work to best
satisfy the objectives of all players, from engineering talent to
business executives to the open source project community itself.
OSPOs act as the conduit and connective tissue between each
group of stakeholders, diplomatically ensuring the interests of
all parties are heard and considered, and negotiating for the best
possible outcomes for all parties collaborating and co-creating
together.

It is this inward and outward-facing service mission that is the
real magic of the OSPO. In this role, the successful OSPO acts as
a diplomat for its organization in the wider world, charged with
representing the needs of the business to the community and
the community’s needs to the business. OSPOs have a unique
role to play as stewards of industry-wide best practices, a locus of
collaboration and co-creation, and a conduit for change agency as
their company evolves in the ever-changing market landscape.

For those who have worked in the open source space for the
past decades, or for readers who are early in their open source
journeys, this whitepaper will present key areas of challenge and
opportunity for the OSPO, shared from senior OSPO leaders
across a variety of industries. Wherever you may be in your OSPO
journey, from having one lone staffer who focuses on open source
software license compliance to having a long-established open 
source strategy, we hope you will find this research valuable in
examining the business value of OSPOs for your enterprise. As
you examine the findings from open source leaders in a variety
of industries, we hope you will see yourself in their journeys
and be inspired. We look forward to your organization joining
the community of OSPO practitioners contributing to the very
foundations of open source practice: how we work together, what
we do together, and how we all can derive mutual benefit.
