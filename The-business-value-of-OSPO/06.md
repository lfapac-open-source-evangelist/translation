# The different hats of an OSPO
## The Counselor

Sometimes a strategic approach just means stepping back and taking the time to think through some of the hard questions about what type of engagement model is right for any particular project or how involved the organization should be in each project. There is also the question of when it makes sense to contribute to an existing project versus creating a new project. An OSPO that is having these strategy-level conversations will be able to provide guidelines to engineers so
that engineers do not have to consider the business implications of different open source engagement models every time they try to solve a problem.

## The Facilitator

The OSPO also plays a sort of translation role between engineering teams and business interests regarding open source. “How do we ensure that engineers keep having the time to do this, that they can actually prove that it makes sense from a business perspective?” said Abernathy, about how communicating the business value of open source is part of the OSPO’s job at F5.
These strategic questions are not always top of mind when the OSPO is first created, especially at less tech- focused companies where open source doesn’t present a direct threat to revenue. But even those companies eventually see that using open source well is about more than mitigating license compliance risk. “Now we are also looking into more cases where it makes sense
from a strategic point of view to leverage open source for our own projects or in collaborations with other parties,” said Schumacher, even though he does not think these strategic concerns were as important when the OSPO was initially set up.

## Ensuring OSPO sustainability
Continuity is an ongoing challenge for organizations as they adapt to changes in the business, the competitive landscape, and the larger technological ecosystem. According to “A Deep Dive on OSPOs,” a Linux Foundation
whitepaper, OSPOs need to establish a clear, easy reporting process and ensure lines of communication stay open with all the stakeholders. This is important for maintaining internal support for the OSPO, which is critical to ensuring that the organization continues to follow its agreed-upon open source strategy and is able to work sustainability on open source projects and priorities.2
