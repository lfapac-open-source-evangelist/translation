# What can OSPOs do for organizations?
## The reasons behind starting an OSPO
As we look at the value that an OSPO provides, there are
two distinct phases. The first phase is the reason behind the OSPO’s creation. The second phase relates to the value that the organization sees as the OSPO matures. In this section, we will address the reasons organizations had for starting the OSPO in the first place and address how the value evolves in a later section. In nearly all cases, there were multiple reasons for starting an OSPO, just as there are multiple reasons for maintaining and expanding the OSPO as it matures. While there can be educational and
social reasons for starting and maintaining an OSPO, this report focuses primarily on the business-related reasons behind having an OSPO, as we have focused the research primarily on for-profit organizations.

### Compliance
The most fundamental reason that organizations start an OSPO is because they are aware that their engineers are using open source, but they don’t know if they’re complying with the projects’ licenses. “Open source is unavoidable,” said Cornelius Schumacher, open source steward at DB Systel, the digital partner of Deutsche Bahn.
** “Open source is unavoidable”**
Given this reality, DB Systel needed to make an organized, centralized effort to ensure that the company complied with open source license requirements as well as managed potential security issues. “Risk management was not the only reason [for creating the OSPO], but certainly an important part of the decision,” he said.
Because new open source projects are being downloaded and used every day, especially in a large organization, the OSPO’s role is less about conducting a compliance audit and more about putting technology and processes in place to ensure developers are aware of which licenses are or are not acceptable so that it’s easier to conduct compliance audits when necessary.

### Building standardized processes around open source
Related to the compliance issue, there was often also a need to move from an ad hoc way of using open source projects to a more standardized process. “Right now we have too much sprawl across our open source dependencies,” Ploug said. Part of the rationale for creating the OSPO was to streamline those dependencies to avoid having multiple projects that accomplish the same things.
**“Right now we have too much sprawl across our open source dependencies”**

This would make many aspects of open source management easier, from license compliance auditing to security to investing strategically in open source projects that are important to the company’s core process.

In addition to building standardized processes around how engineers can use open source, there’s also a need to create standard processes about how engineers can contribute to open source
projects or even create their own projects. In many organizations, these decisions had previously been made between an individual engineer and their manager, the result of which is a blend of approaches and a lack of certainty about what is acceptable.

Often part of an OSPO’s initial mandate is to create policies about both consuming and contributing to open source that are distributed throughout the engineering organization. The goal is to eliminate bottlenecks and confusion for engineers both in using and contributing back to open source.

### Improving an organization’s reputation

Improving an organization’s reputation in the open source ecosystem is an important motivator for many companies to create an OSPO.

** “Our goal was to not only be more strategic and act with intent but also to elevate our reputation in the open source community— to be perceived as and accepted as a responsible, positive contributor to the open source ecosystem,” said Ambiel, of VMware.**

This is particularly important because if a company shows up to a project without any kind of pre-existing relationship and suddenly needs a new feature, or a bug fixed, that request won’t likely be a priority. Whereas if the company has been consistently investing in being part of the community, when they need something, the community may be more likely to prioritize it.

“We need to employ people who have commit rights,” said Prat, of Aiven, referring to commit rights on the projects Aiven is built around. The only way to get that is through continual investment in the project, which is why Aiven created an OSPO to ensure the company, and the individuals it employs, are active in the community.

An OSPO is also a way to share knowledge about how to approach open source. To even be part of the conversation about what it means to use open source strategically, a company probably needs
to establish an OSPO. According to Fukuchi, this knowledge sharing is a big part of the value Sony gets from its OSPO.

> While we associate open source with a grassroots effort from individual engineers, the overwhelming trend in the interviews was the support for OSPOs at the executive level. In the case of large technology companies, like VMware
and Futurewei, the OSPO champion was the CEO. “The CEO realized, oh, open source is not just about technology,” said Xie, from Futurewei. “It is about business. So they had open source moved into the Chief Strategy Office, which is where we’re now.”
Even in more grassroots initiatives, high-level buy-in is common. “I went to our former CTO with that idea myself,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair. “He was very supportive and said, ‘Yes, go ahead’ but also was very realistic in the sense of I cannot guide you, I’m not an expert. And I said, ‘That’s okay. I’m the expert.’”
The obvious takeaway is that in many companies, a strategic relationship with open source is a high-level business concern, not just a technical problem that a group of engineers should solve.


Improving an organization’s reputation is ultimately about being able to work productively with others in the industry as well as being part of the conversation about the direction of key projects. “Growing our reputation allows us to be in larger market conversations in the tech world, where we can then have an impact on products and solutions that are important to us,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair.

### Expanding access to open knowledge
For universities, an OSPO is a way to increase the impact of research and make it more accessible or useful to the wider community, as well as a way to improve students’ access to knowledge.

**“If you have students engaged with reproducing the results, there have already been studies that show that there is a huge, much better learning effect compared to just reading papers.”**

“It’s a huge difference whether a student can just read a paper, or they can look at the paper, then go on to an associated public git repository and have all the information there to reproduce the experiment,” said Maltzahn, of UC Santa Cruz. “If you have students engaged with reproducing the results, there have already been studies that show that there is a huge, much better learning effect compared to just reading papers.” This is important for student retention.
Many students leave computer science prematurely because they get too frustrated by the steep learning curve of getting brittle experimental systems to work in computing environments even experts don’t fully understand. Incorporating the practicality of open source into how students learn and reducing the frustration they experience can help them be successful with computer science in the short term and software development in the long term.

### Improving development velocity
No one starts building a product by creating an operating system—nothing would ever get built.

**“There are parts of our products that consist almost entirely of open source software, and that is a fundamental change in the long history of Ericsson,” said Georg Kunz, open source manager at Ericsson.**

Not only does an OSPO bring order to how the company is consuming open source projects, but it can also provide guidance about which projects to use.

### Improve access to talent
There are two ways that open source improves access to talent. The most obvious way is by allowing organizations to hire higher caliber engineers, either by improving their general reputation in the open source world or even by creating their own open source projects and hiring from the pool of people who become active in those projects’ communities. “My boss and executive sponsor want to know that we have a healthy relationship with the open source community because we need to hire from it,” said O’Brien, of Indeed.

**“One of the biggest challenges we have— like other IT companies—is finding people to do all the software work”**

The other way an OSPO, and the strategic approach to open source that comes with it, can improve access to talent is by creating open source projects that solve an organization’s problems, particularly when solving problems that are common in many organizations,
and solving them doesn’t provide any competitive advantage. “One of the biggest challenges we have—like other IT companies— is finding people to do all the software work,” said Schumacher, of DB Systel. If the company can create an open source project and collaborate with others in the industry, it can leverage tech talent without having to hire more people.

According to Schumacher, encouraging engineers to both use and contribute to open source is also one way to make them happy and less likely to leave. Similarly, encouraging more engineers to create open source projects and do more work in the open is a way to upskill the workforce you already have.

“If we are showing our code externally, if we’re showing our technical prowess externally, there is a certain kind of element of needing to put your best foot forward,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair. She says that as Wayfair has encouraged people to work more in the open, they’ve seen code quality and general adherence to best practices improve.

### Mitigating risks
There are different risks from open source, and a formal OSPO can help mitigate all of them. One reason to formalize the OSPO structure is that one or two engineers are fulfilling an OSPO-like role but without the title or structure. This is what happened at Ericsson. “We basically had a one-person OSPO,” said Kunz.
“He took care of everything, mostly focused on compliance, as many OSPOs start out doing. But obviously, that’s not sustainable. This guy should not get run over by a bus.”

Creating the OSPO formalizes what has often happened in an ad hoc way, reducing the reliance on tribal knowledge and lowering the risk that the departure of a single critical person could put the company at risk of legal issues, security incidents, or just being left out of the open source conversation.

### Security
Ensuring a company is staying as secure as possible—and particularly understanding the software bill of materials going into both internal and external applications—was a recurrent theme about how the OSPO provides value.

** “We cannot develop our own security framework without being in tune with what’s being developed collaboratively in the community”**

However, the examples were on a strategic, rather than strict implementation, level. “We cannot develop our own security framework without being in tune with what’s being developed collaboratively in the community,” said O’Brien, from Indeed. “Then you take that, and you apply that across every domain.”

“By design, it’s a distributed problem,” said Kunz, of Ericsson, about software supply chain security. “It’s not the best engineer who will solve this problem, and you can’t solve this problem with an internal process.” It’s something that requires working with others throughout the industry and the open source ecosystem. An OSPO gives organizations a way to do that, even if the OSPO is not ultimately responsible for implementing security processes. They do
share best practices and facilitate collaboration among open source communities, industry actors, foundations, and other stakeholders to lift all security boats.

Security is also a reason why organizations want to be involved and respected community members in projects that are strategically important to
them. This allows them to be part of the behind-the-scenes conversations not only about any new features in the pipeline but also to learn about any potential security issues first.

### Sustainability
Sometimes open source projects are abandoned, and that can be bad if you depend on them. “If we have a strong dependency on a single maintainer
in Norway, then you should probably do something about the relationship with that person to make sure they stay engaged, either by ensuring that our developers spend time on the projects or by sending some money,” said Ploug, of Spotify. An OSPO both helps identify the risk—otherwise, the fact that it is a single maintainer could be unknown—and identify the best way to mitigate that risk.

This precise issue is what led O’Brien, at Indeed, to create the FOSS contributor fund, which is a way for Indeed to financially support maintainers of projects it depends on. The program’s goal is to support maintainers who are at high risk of burnout as a
way to mitigate the risk that the project will end up abandoned.
 
> **Who’s in the OSPO?**
> 
> The majority of OSPO leaders we spoke to had a software engineering background, but the work most of them do on a day-to-day basis is often not related to writing code. Instead, there are elements of internal communication, strategic planning, analysis, event planning, and collaboration
with external organizations, which include open source communities, foundations, and other industry peers.
> 
> In most cases, OSPO team members, and especially OSPO leaders, were senior engineers or at the management level. In companies with very structured salary bands, the OSPO leadership and team members would be toward the top of the salary ladder.
> 
> Given the importance of legal compliance for many organizations when the OSPO starts, it is notable that most OSPOs had access to legal expertise, either inside or outside the OSPO. However, none of the interviewees felt that there should be an expansion of the role of legal or that they needed additional legal expertise.
