# Conclusion
## What’s coming in the future?

On one point, there was absolute agreement among all interviewees: OPSOs will continue to evolve in the future. In particular, the more established an OPSO is, the more it can think strategically and help the entire organization develop a more strategic, thoughtful approach to open source. What they do
not need or expect is more focus on legal and compliance—that is a checkbox that most interviewees feel is more like the bare minimum and that they have got it covered already.

Several interviewees spoke about expecting OSPOs to play a larger role in influencing which technologies and projects their companies adopt in the future. There was also a hope that OSPOs will be able to dive deeper into the dependency chain to better understand which projects they depend on, even if it is two or three levels down, and track the health of those projects (and contribute where necessary). Others talked about building out automated platforms to handle some of the tasks that are now manual, like approving a request to contribute to a project.

“The OSPO needs to work on a strategy, set it up, and then bring the R&D folks on board to do the right thing,” said Kunz. The OSPO, Kunz and many others believe, should be working on vision and strategy and making sure they’re working with the right people throughout the company to turn that vision into reality.

Ultimately, part of the OSPO’s role is to have these conversations about open source, OSPOs, and the business value it delivers. That is part of open source evangelism, which is already part of many OSPOs’ mission. “I think an important part of that is really making people understand the business value,” said Schumacher.

That is not always easy because open source does not always translate neatly to the things business leaders think about, but it’s important. Business leaders often know that open source is important, but they need an OSPO to help them understand why and then use that knowledge to get even more value out of
open source.

## Future research
In this report, we have focused on the value of the OSPO in private institutions. One area of future research we would like to explore is how OSPOs provide value to governments, from municipalities to supra-national organizations. We would also like to do research that explores the role and the value of OSPOs exclusively at institutions of higher learning. If you have any thoughts about either subject or would like to share your insights, contact us at research@linuxfoundation.org.
