# Measuring an OSPO’s success
# 衡量一个 OSPO 的成功

“When I interviewed for this role, I asked how we’re going to measure success,” Prat said. “They said ‘we don’t know yet.’”

“当我面试这个职位时，我问我们如何衡量成功，” Prat 说。“他们说，‘我们还不知道。’”


This pattern of uncertainty came up often in interviews—that an executive leader championed an OSPO with the understanding that open source is important and that the company needed to take practical, tactical steps to ensure compliance and security, while also figuring out how to engage strategically along the way. In many cases, they did not really know what that looked like, and part of the OSPO’s initial mandate was to figure out what success would look like and how to measure their own progress.

这种不确定的模式在访谈中经常出现 —— 高管领导者提倡 OSPO，并且认识到了开源的重要性，也认识到了公司需要采取切实可行的步骤确保合规性和安全性，同时也弄清楚了如何在这个过程中战略性地参与。但是在许多情况下，他们并不真正知道成功是什么样子的，而 OSPO 最初的部分任务就是弄清楚成功是什么样子的，以及如何衡量他们自己的进展。

There were some metrics interviewees talked about using to measure engagement with open source but then ultimately rejected. Pull requests (PRs), for example, are too diverse to provide meaningful information—a PR could be a typo fix or a major feature. Measuring hours worked on open source also did not seem right because it does not measure impact.

受访者谈到了一些衡量开源参与度的指标，但最终都被拒绝了。例如，PR 太过多样化，无法提供有意义的信息 —— PR 可能是修改一个错别字，也可能是一个主要特性。衡量开源项目的工作时间似乎也不合适，因为它没有衡量影响。

Deciding what to measure is fairly high-stakes and strategic, part of why the OSPO leaders themselves took on the task of figuring it out. Human nature is to optimize for the things we know we’re being evaluated on, and interviewees talked about the importance of choosing metrics that will encourage engineers throughout the organization to be better open source citizens. Often the metrics applied initially changed as the OSPO matured. For example, at Indeed, there was an initial focus on growing contributors and measuring how many people make open source contributions in any given quarter. After a while, however, they started focusing on growing what they called “sustaining contributors,” who are people that make repeated contributions to the same project—to projects that are strategically important to Indeed. This is because it is easier for maintainers to get five contributions from one person than five contributions from five people, and the larger goal is to make things easier for maintainers.

决定衡量什么是相当高风险和战略性的，这也是 OSPO 领导人自己承担这一任务的部分原因。人类的本性是优化我们知道正在被评估的东西，受访者谈到了选择度量标准的重要性，这将鼓励整个组织的工程师成为更好的开源公民。通常，最初应用的指标会随着 OSPO 的成熟而改变。例如，在 Indeed，最初的重点是增加贡献者，并衡量在任何一个季度有多少人对开源做出贡献。然而，过了一段时间，他们开始专注于培养他们所谓的“持续贡献者”，这些人对同一个项目 —— 对Indeed 具有战略重要性的项目 —— 做出重复的贡献。这是因为对于维护者来说，从一个人那里得到五个贡献比从五个人那里得到五个贡献更容易，而且更大的目标是使维护者的工作更容易。

Oftentimes, it is simply difficult to quantify what matters about an OSPO’s performance in numbers. “My personal measure of success is to continue to elevate VMware’s reputation and leadership in open source,” said Ambiel. “And the measures of success I have for that are fairly qualitative.” She talked about perception studies, share of voice, and times when the community organically shared VMware’s story or contributions. Individually, those metrics might be squishy, but together they “add up to a body of work that says we’re making progress.”

通常情况下，很难用数字来量化对 OSPO 表现的影响。“我个人对成功的衡量标准是继续提升 VMware 在开源领域的声誉和领导地位，” Ambiel 说。“我对成功的衡量标准是相当定性的。”她谈到了感知研究、声音分享，以及社区有机地分享 VMware 的故事或贡献的时间。单独来看，这些指标可能是不可靠的，但它们“加在一起，就表明我们正在取得进展。”

So, what did the OSPOs end up measuring once they had time to consider what metrics encouraged good behavior and were truly aligned with the OSPO’s goals?

那么，一旦 OSPO 有时间考虑哪些指标鼓励良好行为并真正符合 OSPO 的目标，他们最终会衡量什么呢?

**Sustaining contributors:** The number of people in the organization who make regular, repeat contributions to the same project, assuming those projects are strategically important to the organization.

**持续贡献者：** 组织中定期、重复地对同一项目做出贡献的人数，假设这些项目对组织具有战略重要性。

The success of projects released: The external participation and impact of projects the organization releases. O’Brien gave the example of a project Indeed released that the CNCF Sandbox accepted as a measure of huge success. Maltzahn, from UC Santa Cruz, mentioned the importance of measuring not just the projects released, but how successful they became at attracting a broader following outside the university and whether they would be viable long term without the continuing involvement of the university.

发布项目的成功：组织发布项目的外部参与和影响。O’Brien 以被 CNCF Sandbox 认为成功项目的 Indeed 为例。来自加州大学圣克鲁斯分校的 Maltzahn 提到，不仅要衡量发布的项目，还要衡量它们在吸引大学以外更广泛的追随者方面的成功程度，以及它们在没有大学持续参与的情况下是否能够长期生存。

**The reputation of open source internally:** Do people even know the OSPO exists? Do they know what the parameters the OSPO has established around how to consume open source, contribute to existing projects, and / or create a new project? Many companies track these internal awareness metrics, as a large part of their role is internal communications.

**开源的内部声誉：** 人们甚至知道 OSPO 的存在吗？他们知道 OSPO 在如何使用开源、为现有项目做出贡献和/或创建新项目方面建立了哪些参数吗？许多公司跟踪这些内部意识指标，因为它们的很大一部分作用是内部沟通。

**The reputation of the organization among the open source community:** For the many companies who established an OSPO as a way to improve the organization’s reputation among the larger open source ecosystem, they often track reputation and awareness metrics, such as social media mentions, the number of job applicants who mention the company’s involvement in open source, or the number of employees speaking at open source-related conferences. Some do surveys of developers run by third parties and ask reputation-related questions.

**组织在开源社区中的声誉：** 对于许多建立 OSPO 以提高组织在更大的开源生态系统中的声誉的公司来说，他们经常跟踪声誉和知名度指标，例如社交媒体提及，提到公司参与开源的求职者数量，或在开源相关会议上发言的员工数量。有些公司对第三方开发人员进行调查，并询问与声誉相关的问题。

**Reducing friction for developers:** In addition to tracking how aware the internal team is of policies, OSPOs often track how much friction they create for those developers. If a human needs to approve a request to contribute, for example, how long does it take?

**减少开发者之间的摩擦：** 除了跟踪内部团队对政策的了解程度，OSPO 通常还会跟踪他们为这些开发者创造了多少摩擦。例如，如果一个人需要批准一个贡献请求，需要多长时间？

**Tracking project health:** Tracking the percentage of projects the organization depends on that are “healthy.” Determining a project’s health would often involve tracking the number of active contributors, the frequency of commits, the number of maintainers, and other metrics, including having users and contributors from many different organizations.

**跟踪项目运行状况：** 跟踪组织所依赖的“健康”项目的百分比。确定项目的健康状况通常涉及跟踪活跃贡献者的数量、提交的频率、维护者的数量和其他指标，包括来自许多不同组织的用户和贡献者。

**External collaboration:** How many partners is the OSPO actively collaborating with? This can take the form of participation in joint ventures or sponsored programs, particularly among universities, or being actively engaged in open source foundations and industry groups. Other examples of active, external collaborations include participation in conferences as speakers, delegates, or sponsors, as well as engaging in the research development process, as many of the interviewees in this report have demonstrated.

**外部合作：** OSPO 与多少合作伙伴积极合作？这可以采取参与合资企业或赞助项目的形式，特别是在大学之间，或者积极参与开源基金会和行业团体。积极的外部合作的其他例子包括作为演讲者、代表或赞助商参加会议，以及参与研究开发过程，正如本报告中的许多受访者所展示的那样。

**There are also joint projects to determine the best metrics to track:**
The TODO Group and CHAOSS created the OSPO metrics working group <sup>3</sup> to help develop better metrics for OSPOs to measure their own success.

**也有联合项目来确定跟踪的最佳指标：** TODO 小组和 CHAOSS 创建了 OSPO 指标工作组 <sup>3</sup>，以帮助 OSPO 开发更好的指标来衡量他们自己的成功。

## The KPI search
## KPI 搜索

Many OSPO leaders stressed that talking about quantitative metrics is not only difficult but can lead to misleading conclusions. Many OSPOs just do not have very measurable goals. “Our goals for the team are relatively high level,” said Kunz, from Ericsson.

许多 OSPO 领导人强调，谈论量化指标不仅困难，而且可能导致误导性结论。许多 OSPO 只是没有非常可衡量的目标。来自爱立信的 Kunz 说:“我们对团队的目标相对较高。

“I would say we step away from numbers,” said Ambiel, from VMware. “Numbers don’t tell the story and can be misleading in open source.”

“我认为我们应该远离数字，”VMware 的 Ambiel 说。“数字并不能说明问题，在开源中可能会产生误导。”

Part of the danger in focusing on numbers, Ambiel said, is that the ultimate goal of the OSPO is to push the company to be a better citizen in the open source ecosystem—and being a good citizen is never-ending. “There isn’t a metric where you can say, okay, I’m done. Check that off,” she said. “You can always lean in; you’re always trying to be better.”

Ambiel 说，关注数字的部分危险在于，OSPO 的最终目标是推动公司在开源生态系统中成为一个更好的公民 —— 而成为一个好公民是永无止境的。“没有一个指标可以让你说，好吧，我完成了。把它划掉，”她说。“你可以随时向前倾；你总是在努力变得更好。”

There can also be problems with timespans. “Every company tries to measure things in three-month timespans,” said Prat, from Aiven. But an open source maintainer does not care that you need to meet your quarterly goals for accepted contributions; they do not arrange open source projects around quarterly goals or fiscal years.

时间跨度也可能存在问题。来自 Aiven 的 Prat 说：“每个公司都试图以三个月的时间跨度来衡量事情。但是一个开源的维护者并不关心你是否需要达到你的季度目标来接受你的贡献；他们不会围绕季度目标或财年安排开源项目。

There was also a sense that OSPOs are continually evolving and, therefore, the right KPIs to track are also constantly evolving. “We are now searching for that good KPI because our activities are changing, and the status quo has changed, so we need to adjust KPIs,” Fukuchi said.

还有一种感觉是，OSPO 在不断发展，因此，要跟踪的正确 KPI 也在不断发展。“ 我们现在正在寻找好的 KPI，因为我们的活动在变化，现状已经改变，所以我们需要调整 KPI，” Fukuchi 说。
