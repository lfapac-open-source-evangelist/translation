# Measuring an OSPO’s success
# 衡量 OSPO 的成功
“When I interviewed for this role, I asked how we’re going to measure success,” Prat said. “They said ‘we don’t know yet.’”

“在我面试这个职位时，我问到我们如何衡量成功”，Prat 说，“他们说‘我们还不知道。’”

This pattern of uncertainty came up often in interviews—that an executive leader championed an OSPO with the understanding that open source is important and that the company needed to take practical, tactical steps to ensure compliance and security, while also figuring out how to engage strategically along the way. In many cases, they did not really know what that looked like, and part of the OSPO’s initial mandate was to figure out what success would look like and how to measure their own progress.

这种不确定的状况在访谈中经常出现 —— 一位高层领导支持 OSPO 并且明白，开源很重要，公司需要采取切实可行的战术行动来确保合规性和安全性，同时也要弄清楚如何在这一过程中进行战略性的参与。在许多情况下，他们真的不知道成功是什么样的，而 OSPO 最初的任务之一是弄清楚成功时的样子以及如何衡量自己的进展。  

There were some metrics interviewees talked about using to measure engagement with open source but then ultimately rejected. Pull requests (PRs), for example, are too diverse to provide meaningful information—a PR could be a typo fix or a major feature. Measuring hours worked on open source also did not seem right because it does not measure impact.

受访者提到了一些衡量开源参与度的指标，但最终没有采纳。例如，提交请求（PR）多种多样，无法提供有意义的信息 —— 一个PR可能是一个拼写错误修复或主要功能。衡量开源工作时间似乎也不正确，因为它不能衡量影响。

Deciding what to measure is fairly high-stakes and strategic, part of why the OSPO leaders themselves took on the task of figuring it out. Human nature is to optimize for the things we know we’re being evaluated on, and interviewees talked about the importance of choosing metrics that will encourage engineers throughout the organization to be better open source citizens. Often the metrics applied initially changed as the OSPO matured. For example, at Indeed, there was an initial focus on growing contributors and measuring how many people make open source contributions in any given quarter. After a while, however, they started focusing on growing what they called “sustaining contributors,” who are people that make repeated contributions to the same project—to projects that are strategically important to Indeed. This is because it is easier for maintainers to get five contributions from one person than five contributions from five people, and the larger goal is to make things easier for maintainers. 

决定衡量什么是相当高风险的和战略性的，这也是 OSPO 领导者自己承担这项任务的原因之一。人类的本性是针对我们所知道的正在评估的东西进行优化，受访者谈到了选择指标的重要性，这些指标将鼓励整个组织的工程师成为更好的开源世界公民。通常，最初应用的指标会随着 OSPO 的成熟而发生变化。例如，在 Indeed，最初的重点是不断增长的贡献者，以及衡量在任意一个季度有多少人做出开源贡献。然而，过了一段时间，他们开始专注于培养他们所说的“持续贡献者”，即那些对同一项目做出持续贡献的人，这些项目对 Indeed 具有重要的战略意义。这是因为维护人员从1个人那里获得5个贡献，比从5个人那里获得5个贡献更容易，更大的目标是让维护人员更轻松。

Oftentimes, it is simply difficult to quantify what matters about an OSPO’s performance in numbers. “My personal measure of success is to continue to elevate VMware’s reputation and leadership in open source,” said Ambiel. “And the measures of success I have for that are fairly qualitative.” She talked about perception studies, share of voice, and times when the community organically shared VMware’s story or contributions. Individually, those metrics might be squishy, but together they “add up to a body of work that says we’re making progress.”

通常情况下，很难用数字来量化 OSPO 的绩效。Ambiel 说：“我个人衡量成功的标准是继续提升 VMware 在开源领域的声誉和领导力。”，“我对成功的衡量标准是相当定性的。”她谈到了认知研究、声量份额，以及社区有机地分享 VMware 的故事或贡献的次数。单独来看这些指标可能不太可靠，但综合起来看，它们“加起来构成了整体的工作，表明我们正在取得进展。”

## Common OSPO KPIs
## 常见的 OSPO KPI 
So, what did the OSPOs end up measuring once they had time to consider what metrics encouraged good behavior and were truly aligned with the OSPO’s goals?

那么，一旦 OSPO 有时间考虑哪些指标鼓励了正向的行为并真正符合 OSPO 的目标，他们最终会衡量什么呢？

**Sustaining contributors:** The number of people in the organization who make regular, repeat contributions to the same project, assuming those projects are strategically important to the organization

**持续贡献者：** 则指组织中定期、多次为同一项目做出贡献的人数，假设这些项目对组织具有战略意义。

The success of projects released: The external participation and impact of projects the organization releases. O’Brien gave the example of a project Indeed released that the CNCF Sandbox accepted as a measure of huge success. Maltzahn, from UC
Santa Cruz, mentioned the importance of measuring not just the projects released, but how successful they became at attracting a broader following outside the university and whether they would be viable long term without the continuing involvement of the university.

**已发布项目的成功：** 组织已发布项目的外部参与度和影响。O’Brien 举了一个例子， Indeed 发布的一个项目被 CNCF Sandbox 接受了，这就可以作为一个巨大成功的衡量标准。来自加州大学圣克鲁斯分校的 Maltzahn 提到，不仅要衡量发布的项目的重要性，还要衡量这些项目在吸引大学之外更广泛的追随者方面取得了多大的成功，以及如果没有大学的持续参与，这些项目是否长期发展下去。

**The reputation of open source internally:** Do people even know the OSPO exists? Do they know what the parameters the OSPO has established around how to consume open source, contribute to existing projects, and / or create a new project? Many companies track these internal awareness metrics, as a large part of their role is internal communications.

**开源的内部声誉：** 人们真的知道 OSPO 的存在吗？他们知道 OSPO 围绕如何使用开源、为现有项目做出贡献和/或创建新项目制定了哪些指标吗？许多公司跟踪这些内部认知指标，因为其很大一部分职责是内部沟通。

**The reputation of the organization among the open source community:** For the many companies who established an OSPO as a way to improve the organization’s reputation among the larger open source ecosystem, they often track reputation and awareness metrics, such as social media mentions, the number of job applicants who mention the company’s involvement in open source, or the number of employees speaking at open source-related conferences. Some do surveys of developers run by third parties and ask reputation-related questions.

**该组织在开源社区的声誉：** 对于许多建立 OSPO 以提高该组织在更大的开源生态中的声誉的公司来说，他们通常会跟踪声誉和知名度指标，如社交媒体提及、提及该公司参与开源的求职者数量，或者在开源相关会议上发言的员工人数。一些人通过第三方对开发者进行调研，并提出与声誉相关的问题。

**Reducing friction for developers:** In addition to tracking how aware the internal team is of policies, OSPOs often track how much friction they create for those developers. If a human needs to approve a request to contribute, for example, how long does it take?

**减少开发人员的摩擦：** 除了跟踪内部团队对政策的了解程度外，OSPO 还经常跟踪他们给开发人员制造了多少摩擦。例如，如果一个人申请批准贡献，需要多长时间完成？

**Tracking project health: **Tracking the percentage of projects the organization depends on that are “healthy.” Determining a project’s health would often involve tracking the number of active contributors, the frequency of commits, the number of maintainers, and other metrics, including having users and contributors from many different organizations.

**跟踪项目健康状况：** 跟踪组织所依赖的“健康”项目的百分比。确定项目的健康状况通常包括跟踪活跃贡献者的数量、提交频率、维护者的数量和其他指标，包括来自许多不同组织的用户和贡献者。

**External collaboration:** How many partners is the OSPO actively collaborating with? This can take the form of participation in joint ventures or sponsored programs, particularly among universities, or being actively engaged in open source foundations and industry groups. Other examples of active, external collaborations include participation in conferences as speakers, delegates, or sponsors, as well as engaging in the research development process, as many of the interviewees in this report have demonstrated.

**外部合作：** OSPO 与多少合作伙伴积极合作？这可以采取参与联合投资或赞助项目的形式，特别是在高校之间，也可以积极参与开源基金会和行业团体。积极的外部合作的其他例子包括作为发言人、代表或赞助商参加会议，以及参与研发过程，就像本报告中的许多受访者所展示的那样。

**There are also joint projects to determine the best metrics to track:**
The TODO Group and CHAOSS created the OSPO metrics working group <sup>3</sup> to help develop better metrics for OSPOs to measure their own success.

**也有一些联合项目来确定要跟踪的最佳指标：**
TODO 小组和 CHAOSS 创建了 OSPO 指标工作组<sup>3</sup>，以帮助为 OSPO 制定更好的指标，衡量其自身的成功。

## The KPI search
## KPI 探索
Many OSPO leaders stressed that talking about quantitative metrics is not only difficult but can lead to misleading conclusions. Many OSPOs just do not have very measurable goals. “Our goals for the team are relatively high level,” said Kunz, from Ericsson.

许多 OSPO 负责人强调，谈论定量指标不仅困难，而且可能导致误导性结论。许多 OSPO 没有非常量化的目标。爱立信的 Kunz 表示：“我们团队的目标相对较高。”

“I would say we step away from numbers,” said Ambiel, from VMware. “Numbers don’t tell the story and can be misleading in open source.”

VMware 的 Ambiel 表示：“我认为我们要远离数字”，“数字并不能说明问题，而且在开源中可能会产生误导。”

Part of the danger in focusing on numbers, Ambiel said, is that the ultimate goal of the OSPO is to push the company to be a better citizen in the open source ecosystem—and being a good citizen is never-ending. “There isn’t a metric where you can say, okay, I’m done. Check that off,” she said. “You can always lean in; you’re always trying to be better.”

Ambiel 说，关注数字的部分危险在于，OSPO 的最终目标是推动公司在开源生态中成为一个更好的公民，成为一个好公民是没有尽头的。她说：“没有一个指标可以让你说，好吧，我搞定了，检查一下”，“你总是可以更进一步，你总是可以努力变得更好。”

There can also be problems with timespans. “Every company tries to measure things in three-month timespans,” said Prat, from Aiven. But an open source maintainer does not care that you need to meet your quarterly goals for accepted contributions; they do not arrange open source projects around quarterly goals or fiscal years.

时间跨度也可能是个问题。“每家公司都试图在三个月的时间跨度内进行衡量，”来自 Aiven 的 Prat 说。但是一个开源维护者并不关心你是否需要达到接受贡献的季度目标；他们不会围绕季度目标或财年安排来计划开源项目。

There was also a sense that OSPOs are continually evolving and, therefore, the right KPIs to track are also constantly evolving. “We are now searching for that good KPI because our activities are changing, and the status quo has changed, so we need to adjust KPIs,” Fukuchi said.

还有一种感觉是，OSPO 正在不断发展，因此，所要跟踪的合适的 KPI 也在不断发展。Fukuchi 说：“我们现在正寻找好的 KPI，因为我们的活动正在变化，现状也发生了变化，所以我们需要调整 KPI。”
