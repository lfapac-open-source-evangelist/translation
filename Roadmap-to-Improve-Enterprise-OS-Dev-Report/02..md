Introduction
============

Corporate participation in open source has reached an all-time high
and continues to grow as organizations realize the value of consuming
and contributing to open source projects

(**FIGURE 1**). In addition, the nature of corporate (also called
enterprise) participation continues to evolve as organizations
increasingly discover that open sourcing proprietary technologies can
create new sources of value and more robust product ecosystems.

Enterprise open source development has challenges, which we discussed
in detail in "[[A Deep Dive into Open Source
Program]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)
[[Offices: Structure, Roles, Responsibilities, and
Challenges]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)."

The enterprise open source journey is challenging (**FIGURE 2**), and
an organization needs to address this to build its open source
leadership. If the organization has a clear plan to implement

internal practices and address those known challenges, the journey
becomes easier. For instance, the Linux Kernel is the largest
collaborative software project in the world, and getting involved in
the development process can be overwhelming.

If you are one of the organizations that rely on the Linux Kernel for
their products and services, investing time and resources into
improving your internal development abilities, contributions process,
and syncing your development with the upstream project can pay off
immensely in the long run.

Fortunately, since so many organizations and individuals have been
successful at contributing to the Linux Kernel, there is a clear path
to improve your own Linux Kernel contributions and aim for a
leadership role.

Several factors drive and motivate participation in open source
projects:

-   Reducing the amount of work needed from product teams

-   Minimizing the cost to maintain source code and internal software
    branches

-   Improving code quality

-   Supporting faster development cycles

-   Producing more stable code to serve as the base for products

-   Improving the organization's reputation in critical open source
    communities

Organizations often upstream modifications to open source projects,
which is a fundamental aspect of the open source methodology.
Following this approach, enterprise developers submit internal changes
to the open source project for evaluation for acceptance into the main
development tree. This process achieves several technical and
nontechnical benefits for the enterprise due to such contributions
(see **FIGURE 3**).

This report covers several practices enterprises can adopt to help
grow their footprint in open source projects.
