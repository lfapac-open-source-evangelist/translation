# Executive summary

As we have done for the last three years, the Linux
Foundation engaged the open source community in
its World of Open Source Survey. In this 2025 edition,
we confirm that organizations depend on open
source software as the backbone of their critical
systems. However, most lack the governance and
security frameworks to manage this dependency
safely. While expecting enterprise-level reliability and
support, organizations systematically underinvest
in the security practices, formal governance structures, community engagement, and comprehensive
strategies that production environments demand.
This misalignment creates business risks and limits
competitive advantages.

Despite open source’s widespread adoption in
mission-critical infrastructure (with 40-55% penetration across operating systems, cloud platforms,
databases, DevOps, and AI) organizational maturity
lags behind usage. Only 26% of organizations have
implemented Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs)
and just 34% have defined clear open source strategies, even though 83% believe open source is
valuable to their future and 46% report increased
business value from open source over the past
year. This governance gap creates substantial risk
exposure given the mission-critical nature of these
deployments.

The security posture is equally concerning. Most
organizations fail to implement basic security evaluation practices, with only 31% using automated
security testing tools. No single security assurance
framework has achieved broad adoption, creating
fragmentation that undermines security across the
ecosystem. Organizations demonstrate inconsistent
evaluation practices, with community health checks
(44%) being more common than security assessments of the technology.

These deficiencies drive organizations toward
commercial support solutions that complement
traditional open source dynamics. A majority of
surveyed organizations demand enterprise-grade
support, with 71% expecting sub-12-hour response
times, and consider paid support essential for
mission-critical workloads (54%), systems handling
sensitive data (43%), and regulated environments
(38%). This shift reflects open source’s evolution from
a cost-saving alternative to foundational business
infrastructure requiring formal service level agreements and dedicated support personnel.

Organizations seeking to capture full value from
open source should consider establishing formal
governance structures, implementing comprehensive security evaluation frameworks, and
transitioning from passive consumption to active
participation. Those with active open source participation are 20% more likely to perceive competitive
advantages than passive users, while also gaining
benefits in workplace satisfaction (78%) and talent
attraction (74%).

Systematic investment can help bridge the maturity
gap. Priorities focus on sponsoring critical dependencies (44%), training developers (41%), and increasing
upstream contributions (39%). Intellectual property
concerns (33%) and licensing complexities (37%)
remain barriers requiring dedicated expertise and
formal governance structures. AI emerges as the
technology domain that benefits most from being
open source (38% of respondents), with adoption
showing a statistically significant 5% increase from
2024.

These findings suggest that organizations that
successfully bridge the governance-adoption gap
through active engagement, formal structures, and
comprehensive security practices capture competitive advantages in talent acquisition, operational
excellence, and market positioning, especially in
emerging areas such as AI. Organizations that do not
treat open source as a strategic ecosystem requiring
dedicated investment and expertise risk falling
behind competitors who understand that open
source involvement has become integral to technological leadership itself.
