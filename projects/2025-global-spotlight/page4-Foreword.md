# Foreword

I’ve been using open source software for well over
a decade now, and it’s easy to take for granted the
number of high-quality, accessible, and powerful
tools that we have at our disposal. It can be hard
to remember that for the longest time, there were
thousands of businesses and millions of people who
had no idea that it existed or that it had the power
to completely transform the way their systems and
businesses work.

Thankfully, that seems to have changed. We’re
excited to be collaborating with the team at The
Linux Foundation this year on this report, which
closely examines the world of open source software
to reveal some exciting trends and shifts in the
wider landscape. Namely: that open source hasn’t
just taken root, but is in full bloom as a mission-critical part of business. This year’s research has gone
beyond measuring open source adoption to look at
why it’s working, the results enterprises are seeing,
and how they’re thinking about the future of open
source.

And the data reveals what I’ve thought since I first
harnessed the power of open source for my own
workstations, or to build an on-premises cloud development and deployment platform that was later
used by thousands of engineers. Open source is
incredible for productivity, and the research this year
confirms that: nearly 86% of respondents indicated
that using open source software improves productivity. For most developers, this will not be a surprise.
I especially love how easy it is to bootstrap a new
project with open source software, and the flexibility
in tooling and workflow it offers. This has been a
personal mission at Canonical since I joined: we want
Ubuntu to be the most powerful, flexible foundation
for developers. Recently, we’ve spearheaded efforts
that focus on ensuring that, no matter what toolchain
you use, you’ll be able to find it in Ubuntu.

It’s not just productivity, but the cost of business too.
As the report shows, 46% of organizations reported
an increase in business value from open source
over the last year. This highlights the impact that
open source is making, and I expect we’ll see this
number continue to grow over the next few years.
We certainly hear the same from customers. In Brazil
for example, one of the country’s largest financial
institutions has seen remarkable resource efficiency
gains from using an open source private cloud,
increasing the number of parallel jobs they run in
their cloud by more than 400%.

However, saving some time and money isn’t such
a great selling point if it’s not sustainable or safe.
More than ever, businesses are demanding more
from their OSS in terms of support and security: this
research found that more than half of organizations
(53%) expect long-term support guarantees, 47%
require rapid security patching capabilities, and an
eye-opening 71% of organizations expect response
times of less than 12 hours from support providers
for open source software in production environments. Historically, support has been the hardest
thing for OSS to offer, given its business model of
passion that relies on grants or donations. But that’s
changing: we introduced Ubuntu Pro to address
exactly these requirements across a wide range
of open source packages and toolchains, and our
customers, from space computing pioneers to industry-leading games publishers, value the peace of
mind it brings them.

For me, these findings indicate that we have a long
way to go in making organizations aware of best
practices for securing their open source supply
chain. Research like this is a step in the right direction though. I hope the resources we’re sharing here
encourage readers to reflect on the benefits they see
from open source software, of which there are many.
While it’s important for us to celebrate providing
a first-class cloud and developer experience, it’s
equally important to pause and reflect on potential
gaps in the security of open source supply chains.
