# Introduction

As part of our ongoing World of Open Source research series,
the 2025 edition investigates how open source is adopted across
core technology stacks and how organizations employ security
evaluation practices, formal governance structures, and support
for open source in production environments. The study examines
regional variations in open source engagement patterns, the
emergence of enterprise-level support expectations that challenge
traditional community-driven models, and the competitive
advantages gained by organizations that successfully transition
from passive consumption to active participation in open source
projects.

This research, based on 851 global survey responses (see
Methodology for demographics), reveals a misalignment between
adoption and governance, providing insights for technology
leaders, executives, and policymakers in an era where open
source has become critical to business operations and competitive
positioning.
