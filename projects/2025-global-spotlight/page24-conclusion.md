# Conclusion

The 2025 World of Open Source Survey reveals a
paradox: while open source software has achieved
mission-critical status with widespread adoption
across enterprise technology stacks, organizational
maturity significantly lags behind this adoption. Only
34% of organizations have defined clear open source
strategies, and just 26% have implemented Open
Source Program Offices. Organizations often require
enterprise-grade support (71% expect <12-hour
response times). They also broadly recognize the
strategic value of open source – 83% believe it’s
valuable to their future, and 72% view active OSS
engagement as a source of competitive advantage.
However, fragmented security evaluation practices,
uncertain ROI measurement frameworks, and IP
concerns limit deeper participation in the ecosystem.
This disconnect creates significant business risks:
organizations depend on foundational technologies
they cannot adequately assess, understand, or
strategically influence.

Key recommendations include the following:

**Establish open source governance structures.**

Organizations should implement Open Source
Program Offices (OSPOs) or formalize open source
strategies to manage compliance, security, and
contribution workflows. Such strategies include
defining clear public positions on open source
engagement to signal commitment to developers and
partners, which can differentiate organizations in
competitive talent markets. Additionally, developing
comprehensive IP governance frameworks and
standardized legal compliance processes is essential
to address the intellectual property concerns cited
by 33% of organizations as barriers to deeper
participation.

**Strengthen security evaluation practices.**

Organizations should move beyond the community
health checks currently used by 44% of organizations
to implement systematic security assessment
frameworks. This includes deploying automated
security testing tools for open source component
evaluation, which is particularly critical given that
only 16% of small companies adopt this practice.
The current fragmentation where no single security
assurance mechanism achieves widespread adoption
must be addressed through standardized security
evaluation criteria, comprehensive Software Bill
of Materials (SBOM) practices, and robust direct
dependency evaluation processes.

**Establish enterprise-grade support arrangements.**

Organizations should establish support
arrangements with sub-12-hour response times
for mission-critical workloads, as expected by
71% of surveyed organizations. This includes
negotiating long-term support guarantees and
rapid security patching capabilities with commercial
providers to meet the expectations of 53% and
47% of organizations respectively. Companies
must define clear criteria for when paid support is
essential, like mission-critical workloads (cited by
54%), sensitive data environments (cited by 43%),
and regulated industry contexts (cited by 38%).
Developing decision frameworks that consider the
operational consequences of system failure can
help organizations balance cost considerations with
business continuity requirements when selecting
support providers.

**Promote strategic participation through active engagement.**

Organizations prioritize sponsoring critical open
source dependencies, which ranks as the top
investment priority for 44% of respondents, to
ensure project sustainability and gain strategic
influence over technology roadmaps. Funding
comprehensive developer training programs to
engage in open source, cited as a priority by 41%
of organizations, enables both effective usage
and upstream contributions. Increasing upstream
collaboration and code contributions, prioritized by
39% of organizations, facilitates the transition from
passive consumption to active participation, which
delivers the 20% competitive advantage gained by
actively engaged organizations compared to passive
users.
