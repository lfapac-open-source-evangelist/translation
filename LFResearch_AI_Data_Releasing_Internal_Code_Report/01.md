摘要
===========================================================================

Corporate participation in open source has reached an all-time high
and continues to grow as companies realize the value of consuming and
contributing to open source projects. The nature of corporate
participation continues to evolve, as companies increasingly discover
that open sourcing proprietary technologies can create new sources of
value and stronger product ecosystems.

随着企业意识到消费和贡献开源项目的价值，其在开源方面的参与度已达历史新高，且持续增长。企业越来越多地发现，开源自有技术可以创造新的价值源和更强大的产品生态，所以其参与意向也持续走高。


Open sourcing a proprietary technology involves far more than just
making the source code available. There are many ways of building or
joining communities to use and help maintain the project, which is why
it should be a well-ordered and deliberate process.

开源一种自有技术不只是局限在源代码开放，有很多种方式来建立或加入社区，以应用并帮助维护项目，因此它应当是一个条理清晰且深思熟虑的过程。


For companies that plan to open source proprietary code as a
standalone open source project, this paper offers a high-level
overview of the process and provides a sample checklist that can help
ensure that all tasks are properly captured and executed.

对于有计划开源自有代码成为一个独立开源项目的企业，本文给出了该过程的顶层概述，并提供了一个示例的检查清单，有助于确保正确识别和执行所有任务。
