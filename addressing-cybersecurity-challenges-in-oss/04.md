# The IT industry must take a more active rol to improve OSS securit and sustainability
# IT 行业必须承担更积极的角色，以改善开源软件的安全性和可持续性。

Open source software has thrived as an alternative engine of innovation for organizations and developers alike. The pervasive use of OSS is testimony to the impact that it has had on the IT industry. However, OSS security and quality requires a full lifecycle commitment which creates additional investments in resources, time, and developers when compared to current practice. This section of the report introduces a variety of OSS security and sustainability challenges and solicits advice from organizations on how to address them.

开源软件作为组织和开发人员等的替代创新引擎而蓬勃发展。 开源软件的广泛使用证明了它对 IT 行业的影响。 然而，开源软件的安全性和质量需要完整生命周期的承诺，与当前实践相比，这会导致在资源、时间和开发人员方面产生额外的投资。 报告的这一部分介绍了各种开源软件安全和可持续性挑战，并征求组织关于如何解决这些挑战的建议。

## Improving the security of oss development
## 改进开源软件开发的安全性

Organizations and developers are no strangers to the importance of best practices for secure software development. The significance of best practices for OSS development was initially voiced in Figure 15 as the 2nd most important activity for improving OSS security. Best practices have been voiced again by 73% of organizations in Figure 16 as the leading way IT industry organizations can improve the security of OSS development. IT industry organizations (such as the Linux Foundation) have taken this responsibility seriously and are delivering best practices content across a variety of channels.

通过提供最佳实践来改善开源软件开发的安全性，这再次表明了最佳实践的重要性。IT 行业组织（例如 Linux 基金会）已经认真对待这一责任，并通过多种渠道提供最佳实践内容。
组织和开发人员对安全软件开发最佳实践的重要性并不陌生。 在图 15 中， 开源软件开发最佳实践的重要性最初被表述为提高开源软件安全性的第二重要活动。 图 16 中，73% 的组织再次表示最佳实践是 IT 行业组织提高开源软件开发安全性的主要方式。 IT 行业组织（如 Linux 基金会）认真对待这一责任，并通过各种渠道提供最佳实践内容。

The 2nd leading improvement, identified by 61% of organizations, is providing tools for analyzing and remediating security vulnerabilities in OSS components. This need is being addressed as part of the OpenSSF’s open source Software Security Mobilization Plan. This plan was released at the Open Source Software Security Summit II in Washington DC on May 12-13, 2022. This plan is available at <https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/>.

第二个主要改进是为分析和修复开源软件组件的安全漏洞提供工具，61% 的组织认可这一点。这个需求正在 OpenSSF 的开源软件安全动员计划中得到解决。该计划于 2022 年 5 月 12 日至 13日在华盛顿特区举行的 “开源软件安全峰会 II” 上发布。该计划可在 https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/ 获取。

The 3rd ranked improvement identified in Figure 16 by 53% of organizations is to provide more training in secure and memory safe programming. Sadly, many software developers have not been trained on how to develop secure software. As noted earlier, there are some courses available today, including one from the OpenSSF, and there is interest in expanding these courses further. Virtually all languages are memory safe by default. C, C++, and Assembly are the only remaining languages in common use that are not memory safe by default. Training courses and books on alternative programming languages are readily available.

在图 16 中被 53% 的组织认可的改进方法是提供更多安全和内存安全编程方面的培训，该方法是排名第三的改进建议。不幸的是，许多软件开发人员并没有接受过如何开发安全软件的培训。正如前面提到的，今天已经有一些课程可用，包括来自 OpenSSF 的课程，并且有兴趣进一步扩展这些课程。几乎所有语言默认情况下都是内存安全的。默认情况下，几乎所有语言都是内存安全的。C、C++ 和汇编是常用的唯一默认不内存安全的语言。关于替代编程语言的培训课程和书籍随时可用。

## Improving open source software resourcing
## 改进开源软件资源分配

OSS resourcing is a growing challenge because of the need to improve the security and quality of OSS components. The Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan, put forward by the OpenSSF, aims to address the following:
* Secure OSS production. Focus on preventing security defects and vulnerabilities in code and open source packages in the färst place.
* Improving vulnerability discovery and remediation. Improving the process for finding defects and fixing them.
* Shorten ecosystem patching response time. Shorten the response time for distributing and implementing fixes.

开放源码软件的资源资源是一个日益严峻的挑战，因为需要提高开放源码软件组件的安全性和质量。OpenSSF提出的开源软件安全动员计划旨在解决以下问题：
* 安全的的开源软件生产。专注于防止代码和开源包中的安全缺陷和漏洞。
* 改进漏洞发现和修复。改进发现缺陷并修复缺陷的过程。
* 缩短生态系统补丁响应时间。缩短分发和实施修补程序的响应时间。

This plan is estimated to cost in the vicinity of $70 million to $110 million per year and is designed to provide a blueprint and services including education, training, tools, and processes to secure the top OSS projects. While this plan will provide a useful model for OSS projects in general, there are millions of ongoihg OSS projects. How will funding for many of these projects be accomplished?

这个计划的预计成本大约为每年 7,000 万至 1.1 亿美元，旨在提供一个蓝图和服务，包括教育、培训、工具和流程，以保障顶级开源项目的安全。虽然这个计划将为一般的开源项目提供有用的模型，但仍有数百万正在进行的开源项目需要资金支持。那么这些项目的资金来源将是如何解决的呢？

Figure 17 addresses this dilemma. The leading response shared by 63% of organizations suggests that employers should provide or increase an incentive to contributors of meaningful OSS projects.
If end-user organizations elected to "give back" to the oss communities they depend on, it would attract more contributors and improve the security and quality of those OSS components.

图 17 解决了这个困境。63% 的组织表示，最重要的反应是雇主应该提供或增加对有意义的开源软件项目贡献者的激励。
如果最终用户组织选择 “回馈” 他们依赖的开源软件社区，它将吸引更多的贡献者，提高这些开源软件组件的安全性和质量。

Industry adoption of standards for interoperability across tools and discounted resources provided by CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) to OSS projects resonate across 51% of organizations in this study.
Interoperability concerns were frustrating and are a characteristic of immature markets. The fragmented nature of today's software security markets suggests that consolidation will occur and help address this problem although the timeframe is unknown.

产业领域采用互操作性标准以实现跨工具的互操作性，以及云服务提供商为开源软件项目提供优惠资源的概念，在本研究中得到了 51% 的组织的共鸣。
互操作性问题令人沮丧，是不成熟市场的特点。当今软件安全市场的分散性表明，市场整合将会发生，从而有助于解决这个问题，但时间尚未确定。

The concept of cloud service providers providing support for secure OSS development is intriguing. Having access to a portfolio of tools adept at secure software development at deeply discounted prices would be a win for developers. It could also be a win for CSPs as an on-ramp to more conventionally priced runtime services.
However, whether this idea has been vetted with CSPs is unknown as is their overall receptivity to the idea.

云服务提供商为安全的开源软件开发提供支持的概念令人感兴趣。以深度折扣价格获得一系列适用于安全软件开发的工具组合对于开发者来说是一种胜利。对于云服务提供商而言，它也可能是一个通向更常规价格的运行时服务的入口。
然而，尚不清楚这个想法是否已经得到了云服务提供商的审查，以及他们对这个想法的整体接受程度。

44% of developers at organizations also embrace having their employer establish a sandbox for developing OSS projects using the same tools they are already familiar with. This is also an intriguing idea and would qualify as yet another perk provided by an employer to their employees who contribute to material OSS projects.

44% 的组织开发人员赞同让雇主建立一个沙箱，使用他们已经熟悉的相同工具进行开源软件项目的开发。这也是一个有趣的想法，将成为雇主为为那些为实质性开源软件项目做出贡献的员工提供的又一个福利。

Although the ideas presented as responses in Figure 17 are speculative, they all reflect the realization that secure OSS development will require additional investment which needs to be provided by the community that benefits from the value derived from OSS.

尽管图 17 中呈现的想法都是推测性的，但它们都反映了这样一个认识：安全的开源软件开发需要额外的投资，这些投资需要由受益于开源软件产生价值的社区提供。

## Snyk - Broken Containers
## Snyk - 损坏的容器

Vulnerability management is complicated enough to start with, but the advent of containers, virtual machine images, IaC, and microservices complicate it even further. While many organizations are still improving how to handle vulnerabilities in their own code, and starting to examine direct and transitive dependencies in depth, fixing the vulnerabilities introduced by containers is still a struggle. Container images (among other constructs) are often "black boxes" that organizations do not examine further.

漏洞管理本来就很复杂，但容器、虚拟机镜像、IaC 和微服务的出现更加复杂化了它。虽然许多组织仍在改进如何处理其自己的代码中的漏洞，并开始深入研究直接和传递依赖项，但修复由容器引入的漏洞仍然很困难。容器镜像（以及其他构造）通常是组织不进一步检查的“黑匣子”。

Returning to our examples of recent vulnerabilities, as of the time of this writing, only 8% of container projects with Spring Framework dependencies have fully remediated the Spring4Shell vulnerability. In contrast, Log4Shell has been resolved in nearly 25% of all containers.

回到我们最近漏洞的示例，截至本文撰写时，只有 8% 的容器项目使用 Spring Framework 依赖项已经完全解决了 Spring4Shell 漏洞。相比之下，几乎 25% 的容器已经解决了 Log4Shell 漏洞。

Because containers can be ephemeral, the act of creating and destroying containers provides an opportunity for implementing updates that could occur rapidly and significantly improve existing vulnerability dynamics. Changing the code in one container configuration could potentially result in hundreds of updated containers. The flip side is that one container configuration forgotten or missed can also easily result in the same number continuing to be vulnerable. This later challenge is one readily resolved through the use of SBOMs.

由于容器可以是短暂的，创建和销毁容器的过程为实施更新提供了机会，这些更新可能会快速地显著改善现有的漏洞动态。在一个容器配置中更改代码可能会导致数百个更新后的容器。另一方面，如果一个容器配置被遗忘或错过，同样数量的容器也很容易继续存在漏洞。这个后面的挑战可以通过使用 SBOMs 来轻松解决。

## Improving OSs sustainability
## 提高开源软件的可持续性

OSS sustainability is an important topic for anyone who depends on OSS. For small OSS projects maintained by a single person, challenges exist. Sustainability requires continuity over time. To achieve this requires the successful ability to transfer maintainer responsibilities to additional maintainers.

对于任何依赖于开源软件的人来说，开源软件的可持续性是一个重要的话题。对于由单个人维护的小型开源软件项目，存在一些挑战。可持续性需要长时间的连续性。要实现这一点，需要成功地将维护者的职责转移给其他维护者。

Figure 18 helps prioritize key activities to help address OSS sustainability. Across organizations, 64% report that maintainers should plan for their own retirement by bringing new maintainers into the project. This is the preferred path forward but requires attention to nontechnical activities focused on process and communication. Adding a second maintainer to a project and transferring responsibility from the original maintainer are likely to be some of the most difficult activities a project must overcome.
Recognizing the challenges of transferring project responsibility, 58% of organizations believe that if a project reaches its end of life the retiring maintainer should clearly identify on the repo that the software is no longer being maintained.

图 18 有助于优先考虑关键活动，以帮助解决 OSS 可持续性问题。64% 的组织报告称，维护者应该通过引入新的维护者来规划自己的退休计划。这是未来的首选方案，但需要关注过程和沟通等非技术活动。将第二个维护者添加到项目中并从原始维护者转移责任可能是项目必须克服的最困难的活动之一。
认识到转移项目责任的挑战，58% 的组织认为，如果项目达到生命周期的终点，退休的维护者应该在存储库中清楚地标识该软件不再得到维护。

An alternative path for transferring maintainership responsibility is to find a foundation or IT industry organization that will create a new home for the project. 55% of organizations endorsed this path forward although it may prove to be nearly as complex as independently finding a new maintainer.

另一种转移维护者责任的替代方案是寻找一个基金会或 IT 行业组织，为该项目创建一个新的家。55% 的组织支持这种未来的方向，虽然这可能会证明几乎和独立找到新维护者一样复杂。
