# Building a FOSS Code Center

## "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."

DOUGLAS ADAMS

## Context

It is common for companies to have a "FOSS code center" or "open
source download center" on their website, where users can download the
(open source) source code for products.

While this delivery system is a great convenience to users, it should
be noted that the GPLv2 license was drafted in a time when broadband
connections were extremely rare, and therefore the focus of the
license is mostly on delivering source code with the product or on a
physical medium like a CD. In 2017, the situation has rapidly changed:
Broadband is widely available (although it should be noted that there
are still many places where broadband is rare, or even non-existent)
and FOSS code centers fulfill all practical needs (namely, access to
source code) for most people.

Although a FOSS code center could fulfill the requirements of the
GPLv2 license in certain cases (like firmware updates, where providing
source code on the same location could then fall under "equivalent
access" from GPLv2, section 3), it should not be seen as a replacement
for the traditional compliance methods, but instead as a convenience
to users.

There are no strict rules when it comes to designing a FOSS code
center, as every website is different. However, there are a few best
practices which are mostly non-technical, that are worth following.

## "FOSS Code Center" as a Requirement

Many companies have a "FOSS code center" on their website. Some of the
companies have added this as an afterthought, and not as a requirement
for the design of the website. And whenever there is a new or updated
website, the designers often are not

[]{#_bookmark28 .anchor}aware of the requirement for a FOSS code
center, and it vanishes, with the company possibly falling out of
compliance.

## Keep Firmware and Source Code Together

Sometimes FOSS code centers are not in the same place as firmware
downloads. It might be useful to keep them together so it is clear
which source code belongs to which firmware. It is recommended to at
least make a reference to the right place in a (separate) FOSS code
center from the firmware download page; otherwise users might not know
where to find the corresponding source code and falsely assume that
there is no source code, which would, of course, cause frustration.

# Tracking Tasks and Processes

## "Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems."

SCOTT ADAMS

## Checklists

A quotation worth bearing in mind with regard to all aspects of
compliance engineering comes from C. Northcote Parkinson:

*"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."*

When used properly, checklists can be a useful way to manage your GPL
compliance tasks in a quick, consistent, and effective manner. When
used incorrectly, they can be too general to cover the work at hand or
become overwhelming catalog requiring endless review. A happy medium
is the goal. What constitutes a happy medium really depends on your
organizational size.

For a small organization, a general compliance checklist could be as
simple as the following:

#### General Compliance Checklist

##### Step #1: Ongoing Compliance Tasks

Discover all FOSS early in the procurement/development cycle. Review
and approve all FOSS packages used.

Verify the information necessary to satisfy FOSS obligations. Review
and approve any outbound contributions to FOSS projects.

##### Step #2: Support Requirements

Ensure adequate compliance staffing and designate clear lines of
responsibility.

Adapt existing business processes to support the FOSS compliance
program.

Make training on the organization's FOSS policy available to everyone.

Track progress of all compliance activities.

This checklist is from the *OpenChain Curriculum slides*,10 which is
based, in turn, on the Linux Foundation Open Compliance Program
*Self-Assessment Compliance Checklist.*11

You might elect to have more specific checklists to address specific
compliance goals. For example, the concept of addressing the "complete
and corresponding" source code for distribution is arguably the first
and most useful area for which to have a specific checklist. One way
of approaching this would be to create an exhaustive list of all the
steps possible and necessary. Another way would be to cover the "core"
of the issue and leave details to trained personnel or sub- checklists
as needed. What follows is an example of the latter.

#### Checklist For Rebuilding Product X

This checklist is part of the check-system for ensuring that "complete
and corresponding" source code is available when distributing products
containing GPL code.

##### Step #1

Is a complete description of the build environment provided?12

##### Step #2

Is a list of rebuild steps provided?

##### Step #3

Has a rebuild been successfully completed on a clean machine?

10. [**https://www.openchainproject.org/curriculum**](https://www.openchainproject.org/curriculum)

11. **[https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-assessment-compliance-checklist)
    [assessment-compliance-checklist](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-assessment-compliance-checklist)**

12. This should include package versions and any similar information
    critical to ensuring compliance.

##### Step #4

Have the rebuild results been verified?

##### Step #5

Have any uncertainties been escalated to the Open Source support team?

Plenty of options exist for more comprehensive checklists. A great
place to start is the Open Compliance Program Self-Assessment
Compliance Checklist. This comprehensive list, which may be required
for a larger organization, is, like the material above, free of charge
and freely available, so you can explore what is best to meet your
requirements.

## Flowcharts

One great way to approach the challenge of managing your GPL
compliance process is to use flowcharts. Like checklists, flowcharts
can be modest or complex. For various reasons, larger organizations
tend towards weighty versions of both. You do not need to. C.
Northcote Parkinson once again has a quote that is applicable in our
context:

*"Expansion means complexity and complexity decay."*

Bearing this in mind, let us take the first steps towards introducing
simple, clear flowcharts for GPL compliance.

Professionals in open source governance have been sharing suggestions
for various flowcharts for years. For example, this photo shows
Jeremiah Foster of the GENIVI Alliance adding thoughts to a
distribution flowchart at an interactive session led by Armijn Hemel
at the Open Compliance Summit 2015 in Japan.

In this section, we explore some example flowcharts that could support
practical GPL compliance with minimum fuss and complexity.

To get the ball rolling, we will highlight an older flowchart loosely
based on work by Arnoud Engelfriet from his tenure as the open source
counsel at Royal Philips Electronics. He kindly shared his approach
with Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) e.V., a charitable
organization focused on promoting Free Software/Open Source, which
then released a modified version to the world through inclusion in
public presentations.

**Flowchart #0** is a great example of what we need to assist our work
as compliance engineers. It is short, clear, and applicable to
physically distributed devices. It pre-assumes relatively light and
responsive infrastructure to support it:

1.  An "approved" list of open source licenses.

2.  A "rejected" list of open source licenses.

3.  A contact in the legal department to deal with any edge cases.

**Flowchart #0** was released into the public domain in January 2008
via FSFE's legal department --- at that time run by Shane Coughlan ---
with the intention of helping to spread knowledge to companies of all
sizes wondering how best to approach process management around open
source.

After reviewing **Flowchart #0**, you will find a series of
interconnected flowcharts prepared by Armijn Hemel to show a more
detailed process for managing compliance matters. These are not
intended to be a panacea for open source compliance flowcharting, but
they do provide a substantial starting point that can be easily
adopted, adapted, and deployed by organizations of all sizes.
